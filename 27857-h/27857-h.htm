<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A PROPHECY</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re cold-blooded as a fish, Roberts,
colder. You&#8217;re&mdash;There is no adequate
simile.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man addressed said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You degrade every consideration in life,
emotional and other, to a dollar-and-cents basis.
Sentiment, ambition, common judgment of right
and wrong, all gravitate to the same level. You
have a single standard of measurement that you
apply to all alike, which alike condemns or justifies.
Summer and Winter, morning, noon, and
night&mdash;it&#8217;s the same. Your little yardstick is
always in evidence, measuring, measuring&mdash;You,
confound you, drive me to distraction with
your eternal &#8216;does it pay.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still the other man said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know,&#8221; apologetically, &#8220;I&#8217;m rubbing it in
pretty hard, Darley, but I can&#8217;t help it. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
exasperate me beyond my boiling point at times
and I simply can&#8217;t avoid bubbling over. I believe
if by any possibility you were ever to have a
romance in your life, and it came on slowly
enough so you could analyze a bit in advance,
you&#8217;d still get out your tape line and tally up to
the old mark: would it pay!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time the other smiled, a smile of tolerant
amusement.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why shouldn&#8217;t I? Being merely the
fish you suggest, it seems to me that that&#8217;s the
one time in a human being&#8217;s life when, more than
another, deliberation is in order. The wider the
creek the longer the wise man will linger on the
margin to estimate the temperature of the current
in event of failure to reach the opposite bank.
Inadvertently, Armstrong, you pass me a compliment.
Merely as an observer, marriage looks
to me like the longest leap a sane man will ever
attempt.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I expected you&#8217;d say that,&#8221; shortly,&mdash;&#8220;predicted
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You give me credit for being consistent, then,
at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re consistent all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thanks. That&#8217;s the first kind word I&#8217;ve
heard in a long time.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
The other made a wry face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t thank me,&#8221; he excepted. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
at all sure I meant the admission to be complimentary;
in fact I hardly think I did. I was
hoping for once I&#8217;d find you napping, without
your measuring stick. In other words&mdash;find you&mdash;human.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And now you&#8217;re convinced the case is hopeless?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Convinced, yes, if I thought you were
serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts laughed, a big-chested, tolerant laugh.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Seems to me you ought to realize by this
time that I am serious, Armstrong. You&#8217;ve
known me long enough. Do you still fancy I&#8217;ve
been posing these last five years you&#8217;ve known
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; you never pose, Darley. This is a compliment,
I think; moreover, it&#8217;s the reason most
of all why I like you.&#8221; He laughed in turn, unconsciously
removing the sting from the observation
following. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see any other possible
excuse for our being friends. We&#8217;re as different
as night is from day.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The criticism was not new, and Roberts said
nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wonder now and then, at times like this,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
remarked Armstrong, &#8220;how long we will stick
together. It&#8217;s been five years, as you say. I
wonder if it&#8217;ll be another five.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The smile vanished from Darley Roberts&#8217;
eyes, leaving them shrewd and gray.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he repeated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;ll come some time, the break. It&#8217;s inevitable.
We&#8217;re fundamentally too different to
avoid a clash.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know so. It&#8217;s written.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And when we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We&#8217;ll hate each other&mdash;as much as we like
each other now. That, too, is written.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Roberts laughed. A listener would have
read self-confidence therein.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, wouldn&#8217;t it be wiser for
us to separate in advance and avoid the horrors
of civil war? I&#8217;ll move out and leave you in
peaceful possession of our cave if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t want you to. I need you.
That&#8217;s another compliment. You hold me down
to earth. You&#8217;re a helpful influence, Darley,
providing one knows you and takes you with
allowance.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The comment was whimsical, but beneath was
a deeper, more tacit admission which both men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
understood, that drowned the surface banter of
the words.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think again, sometimes,&#8221; drifted on Armstrong,
&#8220;that if the powers which are could only
put us both in a pot as I put things together
down in the laboratory, and melt us good and
shake us up, so, until we were all mixed into one,
it would make a better product than either of us
as we are now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; equivocally.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But that&#8217;s the curse of it. The thing can&#8217;t
be done. The Lord put us here, you you, and me
me, and we&#8217;ve got to stick it out to the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And become enemies in the course of events.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; quickly, &#8220;but let&#8217;s not think about it.
It&#8217;ll come soon enough; and meantime&mdash;&#8221; The
sentence halted while with unconscious skill Armstrong
rolled a cigarette&mdash;&#8220;and meantime,&#8221; he
repeated as he scratched a match and waited for
the sulphur to burn free, &#8220;I want to use you.&#8221;
Again the sentence halted while he blew a cloud
of smoke: &#8220;I had another offer to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Following the other&#8217;s example, Roberts lit a
cigar, big and black, and sat puffing in judicial
expectancy.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s what you&#8217;d call a darned good offer,&#8221;
explained Armstrong: &#8220;position as chemist to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
the Graham Specialty Company, who are building
the factory over on the East side&mdash;perfumes
and toilet preparations and that sort of thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Graham himself came to see me. As a matter
of fact he&#8217;s the whole company. He labored with
me for two hours. I had to manufacture an engagement
out of whole cloth to get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you decided&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t decide. I took the matter under
advisement.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Which means that you did decide after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong grimaced in a mannerism all his
own, an action that ended in an all-expressive
shrug. &#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; he admitted reluctantly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I hardly see where I can be of service then,&#8221;
commented the other. &#8220;If you were ten years
younger and a minor and I your guardian&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You might point out with your yardstick
how many kinds of an idiot I am and stir me up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
His companion smiled; as suddenly the look
passed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;d do so cheerfully if it would do any good.
As it is&mdash;&#8221; The sentence ended in comprehensive
silence. &#8220;What, by the way, did Graham
offer?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Five thousand dollars a year, and if I made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
good an interest later in the business. He said
four thousand dollars to begin with and gradually
crawled up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re getting now from the University&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Twelve hundred.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;With ultimate possibilities,&mdash;I emphasize
possibilities&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be dean of the department some day if
I stick.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;With a salary of two thousand a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong nodded.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And that&#8217;s the end, the top round of the ladder
if you were to remain until you were fifty and
were displaced eventually without a pension.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s the biggest plum on the university
tree. It can&#8217;t grow anything larger.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In his place Darley Roberts dropped back as
though he had nothing to say. Involuntarily,
with a nervous impatience distinctive of him, his
fingers tapped twice on the edge of the chair;
then, aroused to attention, the hand lay still.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well?&#8221; commented Armstrong at length.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts merely looked at him, not humorously
nor with intent to tantalize, but with unconscious
analysis written large upon his face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well?&#8221; repeated Armstrong, &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting.
The floor is yours.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was merely wondering,&#8221; slowly, &#8220;how it
would seem to be a person like you. I can&#8217;t
understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t, Darley. As I said a moment
ago, we&#8217;re different as day is from night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was wondering another thing, too, Armstrong.
Do you want to know what it was?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I know in advance I&#8217;ll not have to
blush at a compliment.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I&#8217;m not the judge.
I merely anticipated in fancy the time when you
will wake up. You will some day. It&#8217;s inevitable.
To borrow your phrase, &#8216;it&#8217;s written.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think so?&#8221; The accompanying smile
was appreciative.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know so. It&#8217;s life we&#8217;re living, not
fiction.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And when I do&mdash;pardon me&mdash;come out of
it?&#8221; The questioner was still smiling.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was speculating on.&#8221; Again
the impatient fingers tapped on the chair, and
again halted at their own alarm. &#8220;You&#8217;ll either
be a genius and blossom in a day, or be a dead
failure and go to the devil by the shortest route.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think there&#8217;s no possible middle trail?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not for you. You&#8217;re not built that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The prediction was spoken with finality&mdash;too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
much finality to be taken humorously. Responsively,
bit by bit, the smile left Armstrong&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I won&#8217;t attempt to answer that, Darley, or to
defend myself. To come back to the point, you
think I&#8217;m a fool not to accept Graham&#8217;s offer?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As before, his companion shrugged unconsciously.
That was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Does it occur to you that I might possibly
have a reason&mdash;one that, while it wouldn&#8217;t
show up well under your tape line, to me seems
adequate?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not immune to reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;d like to have me put it in words?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, then, first of all, I&#8217;ve spent ten years
working up to where I am now. I&#8217;ve been
through the mill from laboratory handy-man to
assistant demonstrator, from that to demonstrator,
up again to quiz-master, to substitute-lecturer,
until now I&#8217;m at the head of my department.
That looks small to you, I know; but to me it
means a lot. Two hundred men, bright fellows
too, fill up the amphitheatre every day and listen
to me for an hour. They respect me, have confidence
in my ability&mdash;and I try to merit it. That
means I must study and keep up with the procession
in my line. It&#8217;s an incentive that a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
can&#8217;t have any other way, a practical necessity.
That&#8217;s the first reason. On the other hand, if
I went to work for Graham I&#8217;d be dubbing
around in a back room laboratory all by myself
and doing what he wanted done whether it was
interesting in the least or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;In other words,&#8221; commented Roberts,
&#8220;you&#8217;d be down to bed rock with the two hundred
admirers removed from the bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose so&mdash;looking at it that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right. Go on.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The second reason is that my employment as
full professor gives me an established position&mdash;call
it social position if you wish&mdash;here in the
University that I couldn&#8217;t possibly get in any
other way. They realize what it means to hold the
place, and give me credit for it. We&#8217;re all human
and it&#8217;s pleasant to be appreciated. If I went
to work in a factory I&#8217;d be an alien&mdash;outside
the circle&mdash;and I&#8217;d stay there.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There are eighty million people in the United
States,&#8221; commented Roberts, drily. &#8220;By stretching,
your circle would probably take in two thousand
of that number.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know it&#8217;s limited; but there&#8217;s an old saying
that it&#8217;s better to be a big toad in a small puddle
than a small toad in a large pond.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I recall there&#8217;s an adage to that effect.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Lastly, there&#8217;s another reason, the biggest
of all. As it is now the State employs me to deliver
a certain number of lectures a semester. I
do this; and the rest of the time is mine. In it
I can do what I please. If I accepted a position
in a private enterprise it would be different. I
should sell my time outright&mdash;and be compelled
to deliver it all. I shouldn&#8217;t have an hour I could
call my own except at night, and the chances are
I shouldn&#8217;t have enough energy left for anything
else when night came. You know what I&#8217;m
trying to do&mdash;that I&#8217;m trying to work up a
name as a writer. I&#8217;d have to give up that ambition
entirely. I simply can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t do that
yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been keeping up this&mdash;fight you
mention for ten years now, you told me once. Is
anything definite in sight?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; not exactly definite; but Rome wasn&#8217;t
built in a day. I&#8217;m willing to wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And meantime you&#8217;re getting older steadily.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat I&#8217;m willing to wait&mdash;and trust a
little.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Tap, tap went the impatient fingers again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Something&#8217;s bound to drop in time if one is
only patient.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts looked up quickly, the gray eyes keen,
the tapping fingers stilled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Something has dropped, my friend, and you
don&#8217;t recognize it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The tape line again. The eternal tape line!
It&#8217;s pure waste of energy, Darley, to attempt to
make you understand. As I said before, you&#8217;re
fundamentally incapable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; evenly. &#8220;But for your sake I&#8217;ve
listened and tried. At least give me credit for
that.&#8221; Of a sudden he glanced up keenly. &#8220;By
the way, you&#8217;re not going out this evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, Elice is out of town.&#8221; Armstrong
caught himself. &#8220;I suppose that is what you
meant.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment before he answered Roberts
busied himself with a stray flake of ash on his
sleeve.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, in a way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was going to
suggest that you tell her what you told me before
you said &#8216;no&#8217; to Graham.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s unnecessary.&#8221; The tone was a trifle
stiff. &#8220;She at least understands me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The other man made no comment.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re not going out either this evening,
Darley?&#8221; returned Armstrong.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I&#8217;m scheduled for bed early to-night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
I&#8217;ve had a strenuous day, and to-morrow will be
another.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was already late of a rainy May evening,
the room was getting dim, and silently Armstrong
turned on the electric light. Following, in
equal silence, his companion watching him the
while understandingly, he lit a pipe. Stephen
Armstrong seldom descended to a pipe, and when
he did so the meaning of the action to one who
knew him well was lucid. It meant confidence.
Back in his seat he puffed hard for a half minute;
then blew at the smoke above his head.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Was that mere chance that made you suggest&mdash;Elice
in connection with that offer of Graham&#8217;s,&#8221;
he asked, at last; &#8220;or did you mean more
than the question seemed to imply, Darley?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again for an appreciable space there was
silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I seldom do things by chance, Armstrong.
To use your own simile, I&#8217;m too much of a fish.
I don&#8217;t want to seem to interfere with your personal
affairs, however. I beg your pardon if you
wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t wish you to do so,&#8221; shortly. &#8220;You
know that. Besides there&#8217;s nothing to conceal
so far as I&#8217;m concerned. Just what did you
mean to suggest?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the other hesitated, with a reluctance
that was not simulated. Darley Roberts simulated
nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If you really wish to know,&#8221; he complied at
last, &#8220;I think you ought to tell, her&mdash;without
coloring the matter by your own point of view
in the least. She should be as much interested
as you yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She is. Take that for granted.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts waited.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know, though, so certainly what she would
say that it seems a bit superfluous.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still Roberts waited.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As I said before, she understands me and I
understand her. Some things don&#8217;t require language
to express. They come by intuition.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
And still Roberts waited.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If it were you, now, and there were any possibility
of a yardstick it would be different; but
as it is&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Miss Gleason then, Mrs. Armstrong to be,
doesn&#8217;t care in the least to see you come on financially,
is completely satisfied with things as they
are?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was Armstrong&#8217;s turn to be silent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been engaged now three years.
You&#8217;re thirty years old and Miss Gleason is&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Twenty-five in August.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She is wholly contented to let the engagement
run on indefinitely, knowing that your income is
barely enough for one to live on and not at all
adequate for two?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The other stiffened involuntarily; but he said
nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I beg your pardon the second time, Armstrong,
if you wish; but remember, please, I&#8217;m
doing this by request.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know, Darley. I&#8217;m not an absolute cad,
and I&#8217;m glad you are frank. Doubtless from
your point of view I&#8217;m a visionary ass. But I
don&#8217;t see where any one suffers on that account
except myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t see where any one suffers save yourself!
Don&#8217;t see&mdash;! You can&#8217;t be serious, man!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong had ceased smoking. The pipe lay
idle in his fingers.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. Come out into the clearing and put it
in plain English. Just what do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Since you insist, I mean just this, Armstrong&mdash;and
if you&#8217;ll think a moment you&#8217;ll realize
for yourself it&#8217;s true: you can&#8217;t drift on forever
the way you&#8217;re doing now. If you weren&#8217;t
engaged it would be different; but you are engaged.
Such being the case it implies a responsibility
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and a big one. To dangle so is unjust
to the girl. Let this apply in the abstract. It&#8217;s
damnably unjust!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think that I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think at all, I know. We can theorize
and moon and drift about in the clouds all we
please; but when eventually our pipe goes out
and we come down to earth this thing of marriage
is practical. It&#8217;s give and take, with a
whole lot to give. I haven&#8217;t been practising law
and dealing with marital difficulties, to say nothing
of divorces, without getting a few inside facts.
Marriages are made in Heaven, perhaps, but
married life is lived right here on earth; and the
butcher and the rest play leading parts. I recognize
I&#8217;m leading the procession a bit now, Armstrong;
but as I said before, you can&#8217;t dangle
much longer if you&#8217;re an honorable man; and
then what I&#8217;ve said is right in line. If you&#8217;ll
take a word of advice that&#8217;s intended right, even
if it seems patronizing, you&#8217;ll wake up right now
and begin to steer straight for the flag-pole. If
you keep on floundering aimlessly and waiting
for an act of Providence you&#8217;ll come to grief as
surely as to-morrow is coming, old man.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And by steering straight you mean to save
money. To get my eye on a dollar, leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
everything else, and chase it until it drops from
fatigue.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I mean get power; and dollars are the tangible
evidence and manifestation of power. They
are the only medium that passes current in any
country any day in the year.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong smiled, a smile that was not pleasant
to see.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;d have me give up my literary aspirations
then, let them die a-borning as it were&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that. So far as I can see you
can keep on just the same. There are twenty-four
hours in every day. But make that phase
secondary. I don&#8217;t discount writers in the least
or their work; but with the world as it is the
main chance doesn&#8217;t lie that way&mdash;and it&#8217;s the
main chance we&#8217;re all after. Fish or no fish, I
tell you some time you&#8217;ll find this out for yourself.
To get the most out of life a man must be
in the position to pass current wherever he may
be. In the millennium the standard may be different&mdash;I
for one sincerely hope it will be; but
in the twentieth century dollars are the key that
unlocks everything. Without them you&#8217;re as
helpless as a South Sea islander in a metropolitan
street. You&#8217;re at the mercy of every human
being that wants to give you a kick; and the majority
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
will give it to you if they see you are
defenceless.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong was still smiling, the same being a
smile not pleasant to see.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve got you going,&#8221; he commented,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve a curiosity to have you keep on.
You&#8217;re certainly stirring with a vengeance to-night,
Darley.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And accomplishing nothing. Strange as it
may seem to you, I&#8217;m serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it, old man.&#8221; Of a sudden the
smile had passed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t adjust my point of
view to yours at all. If I thought dollars were
the end of existence I&#8217;d quit the game now. If
the world has come to this&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The world hasn&#8217;t come to it and never will.
You simply can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t see the point. I
repeat, that of themselves they&#8217;re nothing, but
they&#8217;re the means to everything. Get your competency
first, your balance-wheel, your independence,
your established base of supplies; then
plan your campaign. The world is big, infinitely
big, to the human being who can command. It&#8217;s
a little mud ball to the other who has to dance
whenever some one else whistles.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And how about happiness, the thing we&#8217;re
all after?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t happiness, but it&#8217;s the means to it.
There can be no happiness without independence.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Even marital happiness?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That most of all. I tell you the lack of a
sufficient income is the rock on which most married
people go to pieces. It isn&#8217;t the only one,
but it&#8217;s the most frequent. I&#8217;ve seen and I
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;d drive our old friend Cupid out of
business, Darley. You don&#8217;t give him an inch
of ground to stand on.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;On the contrary, I keep him in business
indefinitely&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Moreover, the examples of the rich, scattered
broadcast through the daily papers, hardly bear
you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They are the exception that proves the rule.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine poor couples come
to grief, and the world never hears of it. In the
thousandth case a rich man and woman make
fools of themselves and the world reads the scandal
next morning. The principle is unaltered.
The exceptions, the irresponsibles whether rich or
poor, are something to which no rule applies.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right.&#8221; Armstrong sat up, preventingly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to argue with you. You&#8217;re a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
typical lawyer and always ride me down by pure
force of mass.&#8221; He smiled. &#8220;Gentlemen of the
law are invariably that way, Darley. Figuratively,
you fellows always travel horseback while
the rest of us go afoot, and if we don&#8217;t hustle out
of the way you ride us down without remorse.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts was listening again in silence, with his
normal attitude of passive observance.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling pretty spry, though, to-night,&#8221;
went on the other, &#8220;and able to get out of the
way, so I&#8217;m going to get in close as possible and
watch you. I&#8217;ve tried to do so before, but somehow
I&#8217;m always side-tracked just at the psychological
moment.&#8221; The quizzical voice became
serious, the flippant manner vanished. &#8220;Honestly,
Darley, I can&#8217;t understand you any more
than you can me. You said a bit ago you wondered
where I would end. I have the same
wonder about you. Just what are you aiming at,
old man, anyway? In all the years I&#8217;ve known
you <i>you&#8217;ve</i> never come right out and said in so
many words.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean what do I intend to do that will
make me famous or infamous, that will at least
make me talked about?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong laughed shortly. The shot was
well aimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose that is approximately what I had
in mind,&#8221; he admitted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To answer your question then, directly, I
don&#8217;t intend to do anything. Nothing is further
from my plans than to get a position where I&#8217;ll
be talked about.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just what do you want, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I want the substance, not the husk. I want to
be the party that pulls the wires and not the figures
that dance on the front of the stage. I want
things done when I say they shall be done. I
want the piper to play when I pass the word.
I&#8217;m perfectly willing that others should have the
honor and the glory and the limelight; but after
the play is over I want to be the boy to whom
the report is made and who gives directions for
the next performance. Is that definite enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, definite enough; but are you going to
get there? You asked me the same question,
you recall, a bit ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, if I live.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And if you don&#8217;t live?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the shrug. &#8220;I shall have tried. I can
tell Saint Peter that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t refer to Saint Peter. I meant you
yourself. Where is your own justification except
in the attainment of the end?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Justification!&#8221; Roberts leaned suddenly forward,
his attitude no longer that of an observer
but of a participant, one in the front of the
charge. &#8220;The game is its own justification,
man! Things don&#8217;t have to be done with two hundred
bright young students watching and listening
to be worth while, my friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong shifted uncomfortably, then he
tacked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just one more question, a repetition again of
your own. Have you the attainment of this object
you suggest definitely in sight? You&#8217;re
older than I and have been playing the game some
time yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think so.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you know so?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As nearly as a man can know anything that
hasn&#8217;t come to pass.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just how, Darley? I&#8217;m absolutely in the
dark in regard to your deals and I&#8217;m curious to
know the inside. You&#8217;ve got something particular
in mind, I know, or you wouldn&#8217;t speak that
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the first time in minutes Roberts looked at
the other, looked steadily, blankly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry genuinely, Armstrong, but I
can&#8217;t tell you now. Don&#8217;t misunderstand, please.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
I&#8217;d tell you if I were not under obligation; but
I&#8217;m not at liberty yet to say.&#8221; His glance left
the other&#8217;s face. &#8220;I trust you understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, certainly.&#8221; The voice was short. &#8220;No
offence, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
That there was offence was obvious, yet Roberts
made no further comment or explanation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For perhaps a minute there was silence; in
characteristic change of thought absolute Armstrong
shifted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As long as we&#8217;re in the confidant business,&#8221;
he digressed, &#8220;there&#8217;s still one question I&#8217;d like
to ask, Darley. Elice and I have been intimate
now for a number of years. I&#8217;ve asked you repeatedly
to call with me and you&#8217;ve always
refused. Even yet you&#8217;ve barely met her. I
quote you by the yard when I&#8217;m with her, and,
frankly, she&#8217;s&mdash;curious why you stay at arm&#8217;s
length. Between yourself and myself why is it,
Darley?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts laughed; an instant later the light left
his face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know I have few women acquaintances,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know, but this particular case is different.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And those I do have,&#8221; completed the other,
&#8220;are all securely married.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong colored.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; smiled Roberts, &#8220;and
you know I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not fool enough to fancy
I&#8217;m a charmer. The explanation, I believe, is in
my ancestry. I think they must have been fishes
too, and instinct warns me to avoid bait. It&#8217;s
my own peace of mind I&#8217;m considering and preserving,
friend Armstrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Peace of mind!&#8221; the other laughed. &#8220;From
you that&#8217;s good, Darley. But the tape line&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I confess&mdash;You think there is a time then,
after all, when it pays?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you fancy I show signs of feeble-mindedness?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, emphatically not; but&mdash;Jove, you are
human then after all! I begin to have hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts stifled a yawn, a real yawn.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll turn in,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just a moment, Darley. I feel as though
I&#8217;d discovered a gold mine, and I want to blaze
its location before departing. Just when, with
your philosophy, do you contemplate taking this
important leap among the attached?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts looked at his companion in silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me, Darley,&#8221; swiftly, &#8220;that was flippant,
I admit, but I&#8217;m really serious.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Serious? I&#8217;ll take you at your word. It&#8217;ll
be when I mean business, not pastime. Stretch
the tape if you wish. There are some things it
doesn&#8217;t pay to play with. It&#8217;ll be when I can
give a woman the things, the material things, she
wants and demands to make her happy and contented.
The world is artificial, and material
things are its reflection. When I can make the
woman who chooses to marry me pass current
anywhere, when I can be the means of giving her
more pleasure, more opportunity, more of the good
things of life than she has known before, then,
when I know, not hope, this,&mdash;and not a minute
before&mdash;Does that answer your question?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s clear enough, I&#8217;m sure&mdash;the
implication, too, for that matter.&#8221; The speaker
yawned, unnecessarily it seemed, for his look was
keen. &#8220;By the way, though, you haven&#8217;t given
me a satisfactory explanation for avoiding Elice.
She&#8217;s attached practically, not unattached; and
I personally want you to know her. I think it
would make you understand some things you
don&#8217;t understand now. You might even approve
of&mdash;dangling. What do you say, will you go
out with me some evening or will you have another
engagement as usual? I shan&#8217;t suggest it
again, Darley.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Standing, as he had risen a moment before,
Darley Roberts looked down at the speaker
steadily, the distinctive half-smile of tolerant
analysis upon his lips. He laughed outright as
though to clear the atmosphere.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly I&#8217;ll go, Armstrong, if you wish.
It never occurred to me before that you took it
that way. I had supposed that you and Elice
were an example of two being a company and
three making a crowd; also, to change the simile,
that previously your invitations were the proverbial
crumbs of charity. I&#8217;ll be pleased to go any
time you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right.&#8221; Armstrong too had risen.
&#8220;How about Sunday evening next week? Elice
will be back Saturday.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A week from Sunday; I shall not forget.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
With the attitude of a big healthy animal, a
bit sleepy now, Roberts stretched himself luxuriously,
then started for his own room adjoining,
calling back, &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong watched him in silence until the
other&#8217;s hand was on the knob.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he echoed absently.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>UNDERSTANDING</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What is it, Elice? You&#8217;re transparent
as spring water. Out with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Out with what, Steve?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The secret information of vital importance
that you&#8217;re holding back with an effort for a
favorable moment to deliver. The present isn&#8217;t
particularly dramatic, I&#8217;ll admit, but it&#8217;s the
best circumstances permit.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re simply absurd, Steve; more so than
usual.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, merely ordinarily observant. I&#8217;ve known
you some time, and the symptoms are infallible.
When you get that absent, beyond-earth look in
your eyes, and sit twisting around and around
that mammoth diamond ring your uncle gave you
on your sixteenth birthday&mdash;Come, I&#8217;m impatient
from the toes up. Who is engaged now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No one, so far as I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Married, then; don&#8217;t try to fool me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Who told you, Steve Armstrong?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No one.&#8221; The accompanying laugh was
positively boyish. &#8220;I knew it was one or the
other. Come, &#8217;fess up. I&#8217;ll be good, honest.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You get younger every day, Steve,&#8221; grudgingly.
&#8220;If you keep on going backward people
will be taking me for your mother soon instead
of&mdash;merely myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t go away then, Elice. I&#8217;m
tickled sick and irresponsible almost to have you
back. I&#8217;m not to blame. But we&#8217;re losing valuable
time. I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You swear that you don&#8217;t know already&mdash;that
you aren&#8217;t merely making fun of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;On my honor as full professor of chemistry.
I haven&#8217;t even a suspicion.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wonder if you are serious&mdash;somehow I
never know. I&#8217;ll risk it anyway, and if you&#8217;re
just leading me on I&#8217;ll never forgive you, Steve,
never. It&#8217;s Margery.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Margery! The deuce it is&mdash;and Harry
Randall, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly. Who&#8217;d you think it was: Professor
Wilson with his eight children?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Now I call that unkind, Elice. After all the
interest I&#8217;ve shown, too! Honest, though, I am
struck all in a heap. I never dreamed of such a
thing&mdash;now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The result of the revelation was adequate and
Miss Gleason relented.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It was rather &#8216;sudden,&#8217; as they say. No one
knew of it except their own families.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sudden! I should decidedly say so. I
certainly thought they at least were to be depended
upon, were standbys. When did it
happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Last evening. Agnes Simpson just told me
before you came.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She did, did she? I thought she looked wondrous
mysterious when I met her down the street.
It was justifiable, though, under the circumstances.
I suppose they, the Randalls, have
gone away somewhere?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; that&#8217;s the funny part of it. They
haven&#8217;t gone and aren&#8217;t going.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. I&#8217;m quoting Agnes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why aren&#8217;t they going? Did Agnes
explain that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve, you&#8217;re horrid again.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; merely curious this time. Agnes is
something of an authority, you&#8217;ll admit.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I guess I&#8217;ll have to admit that. I
didn&#8217;t ask her, though, Steve Armstrong. She
suggested gratis&mdash;that Harry couldn&#8217;t afford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
it. They went into debt to buy furnishings for
the house as it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it. History pays even less than
chemistry, and the Lord knows&mdash;No; I don&#8217;t
doubt it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Knows what, Steve?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Who knows what?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The one you suggested.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh! I guess you caught the inference all
right. No need to have put it in the abstract.
We professors of the younger set are all in the
same boat. We&#8217;d all have to go into debt under
like circumstances.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason meditated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But Harry&#8217;s been a full professor now a long
time,&#8221; she commented; &#8220;two years longer than
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And what difference does that make? He
just lives on his salary.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Is that so? I never thought of it that way.
I don&#8217;t think I ever considered the financial side
before at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong looked his approval.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I dare say not, Elice; and I for one am
mighty glad you didn&#8217;t. Life is cheap enough
at best without adding to its cheapness unnecessarily.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl seemed scarcely to hear him, missing
the argument entirely.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose, though,&#8221; she commented reflectively,
&#8220;when one does think of it, that it&#8217;ll be
rather hard on Margery to scrimp. She&#8217;s always
had everything she wants and isn&#8217;t used to
economizing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong sat a moment in thought. He
gave his habitual shrug.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She should have thought of that before the
minister came,&#8221; he dismissed with finality. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a trifle late now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They&#8217;ve been putting it off for a long time,
though,&#8221; justified the girl, &#8220;and probably she
thought&mdash;one has to cease delaying some
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice! Elice!&#8221; Armstrong laughed banteringly.
&#8220;I believe you&#8217;ve got the June bug fluttering
in your bonnet too. It&#8217;s contagious this
time of year, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Shame on you, Steve!&#8221; The voice was dripping
with reproach. &#8220;You always will be personal.
You know I didn&#8217;t mean it that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not a bit, honest now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I say you ought to be ashamed to make fun
of me that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But honest&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well,&#8221; reluctantly, &#8220;maybe I did just a bit.
We too have been engaged quite a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Almost as long as the Randalls.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The quizzical look left Armstrong&#8217;s eyes, but
he said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I suppose every woman wants a home
of her own. It&#8217;s an instinct. I think I understand
Margery.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From out the porch of the Gleason cottage,
shaded from the curious by its climbing rose-vines,
the girl looked forth at the sputtering
electric globe on the corner.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And, besides, people get to talking and smiling
and making it unpleasant for a girl after so
long. It was so with Margery. I know, although
she never told me. It bothered her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You say after so long, Elice. How long?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean any particular length of time,
Steve. There isn&#8217;t any rule by which you can
measure gossip, so far as I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Approximately, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh, after a year, I suppose. It&#8217;s about then
that there&#8217;s a comment or two sandwiched between
the red and blue decks at bridge parties.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And we&#8217;ve been engaged now three years.
Do they ever sandwich&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How do I know. They don&#8217;t do it to one&#8217;s
face.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But Margery&mdash;you say they made it uncomfortable
for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve Armstrong,&#8221; the voice was intentionally
severe, &#8220;what possesses you to-night? I
can&#8217;t fancy what put that notion into your head.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You did yourself,&#8221; serenely, &#8220;just now. I
never happened to stumble upon this particular
continent before, and I&#8217;m intent on exploration
and discovery. Honest, do they,&#8221; he made an
all-inclusive gesture, &#8220;talk about you and me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I tell you they don&#8217;t do those things to our
faces.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re evading the question, girl Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They&#8217;re not unpleasant intentionally.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Still evasion. Out with it. Let&#8217;s clear the
air.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl drummed on the arm of her chair, first
with one hand, then with the other. At last she
looked the questioner fairly in the face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Frankly, Steve, they do; and they have for
a year. But I don&#8217;t mind. I didn&#8217;t intend to
say anything to you about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The look of the boy vanished from the other&#8217;s
eyes.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&mdash;see,&#8221; he commented slowly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;People are horrid that way, even people
otherwise nice,&#8221; amplified the girl. &#8220;As soon as
any one they know has an&mdash;affair it immediately
becomes public property. It&#8217;s almost as
bad as a murder case. The whole thing is tried
and settled out of court.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The figure of the man settled down in his chair
to the small of his back. His fingers locked over
one knee.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose it was something of that kind Darley
had in mind,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley Roberts? When?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We were talking about&mdash;similar cases a few
days ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You were?&#8221; There was just a shade of
pique in the tone. &#8220;He must be a regular fount
of wisdom. You&#8217;re always quoting him.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He is,&#8221; tranquilly. &#8220;By the way, with your
permission, he&#8217;s going to call with me to-morrow
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;With my permission!&#8221; The girl laughed.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve solicited, and received, that several
times before&mdash;and without result. I&#8217;m almost
beginning to doubt the gentleman&#8217;s existence.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You won&#8217;t much longer. I invited him and
he accepted. He always does what he says he&#8217;ll
do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; the voice was non-committal.
&#8220;I&#8217;m always glad to meet any of your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong warmed, as he always did when
speaking of Darley Roberts.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You will be when you know him, I&#8217;m sure.
That&#8217;s why I asked him to come. He&#8217;s an odd
chap and slow to thaw, but there isn&#8217;t another
lawyer in town, not even in the department, who&#8217;s
got his brains.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t have, very well, could they?&#8221;
evenly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that was a trifle involved; but you
know what I mean. He&#8217;s what in an undergraduate
they call a grind. The kind biographers
describe as &#8216;hewing forever to the line.&#8217; If we
live and retain reasonably good health we&#8217;ll hear
of him some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I repeat,&#8221; smilingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of
him a great deal already.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong said nothing, which indicated mild
irritation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Excuse me, Steve,&#8221; said the girl, contritely.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be sarcastic; that just slipped
out. He has acted sort of queer, though, considering
he&#8217;s your room-mate and&mdash;I had that in
mind. I am interested, however, really. Tell me
about him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong glanced at his companion; his gaze
returned to his patent leather pumps, which he
inspected with absent-minded concentration.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I have told you before, I guess, about all I
know. He&#8217;s a good deal of an enigma to me,
even yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By the way, how did you happen to get acquainted
with him, Steve?&#8221; From the manner
spoken the question might or might not have been
from genuine interest. &#8220;You&#8217;ve never told me
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh, it just happened, I guess. We were in
the collegiate department together at first.&#8221; He
laughed shortly. &#8220;No, it didn&#8217;t just happen
either after all. I went more than half way&mdash;I
recognize that now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Looking back,&#8221; continued the man, &#8220;I see
the reason, too. He fascinated me then, as he does
yet. I&#8217;ve had comparatively an easy enough sort
of life. I was brought up in town, where there
was nothing particular for a boy to do, and when
it came college time my father backed me completely.
Darley was the opposite exactly, and he
interested me. He was unsocial; somehow that
interested me more. I used to wonder why he
was so when I first knew him; bit by bit I gathered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
his history and I wondered less. He&#8217;s had
a rough-and-tumble time of it from a youngster
up.&#8221; The voice halted suddenly, and the speaker
looked at his companion equivocally. &#8220;Still interested,
are you, Elice? I don&#8217;t want to be a bore.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the story then as I&#8217;ve patched
it together from time to time. I suppose he had
parents once; but as they never figured, I infer
they died when he was young. He came from the
tall meadows out West straight to the University
here. How he got the educational ambition
I haven&#8217;t the remotest idea; somehow he got it
and somehow he came. It must have been a rub
to make it. He&#8217;s mentioned times of working
on a farm, of chopping ties in Missouri, of heaving
coal in a bituminous mine in Iowa, of&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know what all. And still he was only a boy
when I first saw him; a great, big, over-aged boy
with a big chin and bigger hands. The peculiar
part is that he wasn&#8217;t awkward and never has
been. Even when he first showed up here green
the boys never made a mark of him.&#8221; Again the
short expressive laugh. &#8220;I think perhaps they
were a bit afraid of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And he got right into the University?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Bless you, no; only tentatively. He had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
lot of back work to make up at the academy.
That didn&#8217;t bother him apparently. He swallowed
that and the regular course whole and cried
for more.&#8221; Armstrong stretched lazily. His
hands sought his pockets. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s about
all I know of the story,&#8221; he completed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All except after he was graduated.&#8221; It was
interest genuine now.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So you have begun to take notice at last,&#8221;
commented Armstrong, smilingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m a better
<i>raconteur</i> than I imagined. When it comes to
being specific, though, after he graduated, I
admit I can&#8217;t say much authoritatively. He&#8217;ll
talk about anything, ordinarily, except himself.
I know of a dozen cases from the papers, some of
them big ones, that he&#8217;s been concerned in during
the last few years; but he&#8217;s never mentioned
them to me. He seemed to get in right from the
start. How he managed to turn the trick I
haven&#8217;t the slightest conception; he simply did.
As I said before, he grows to be more of an
enigma to me all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Apparently the girl lost interest in the party
under discussion; at least she asked no more questions
and, dilatory as usual when not definitely
directed, Armstrong dropped the lead. For a
minute they sat so, gazing out into the night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
silent. Under stimulus of a new thought, point
blank, whimsical, came a change of subject.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By the way,&#8221; commented Armstrong, &#8220;I&#8217;m
considering quitting the University and going
into business, Elice. What do you think of the
idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What&mdash;I beg your pardon, Steve.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The other repeated the question, all but soberly
this time.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you mean it, Steve, really, or are you just
drawing me out?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mean it!&#8221; Armstrong laughed. &#8220;Perhaps,
and perhaps not. I don&#8217;t know. What do you
think of the notion, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl looked at him steadily, a sudden
wrinkle between her eyes.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You have something special in mind, I
judge, Steve; something I don&#8217;t know about.
What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Special!&#8221; Armstrong laughed again, shortly
this time. &#8220;Yes, I suppose so; though I didn&#8217;t
know it when I first asked the question. Now
I&#8217;m uncertain&mdash;you take the suggestion so seriously.
Graham, the specialty man, made me an
offer to-day to go in with him. Five thousand
dollars a year to start with, and a prospect of
more later on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The wrinkle between the girl&#8217;s eyes smoothed.
Her hands recrossed in her lap.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You refused the offer, I judge,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; that is, I told him I&#8217;d take the matter
under advisement.&#8221; Armstrong glanced at his
companion swiftly; but she was not looking at
him and he too stared out into the night. &#8220;I
wanted to hear what you said about it first.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the darkness the man&#8217;s face colored.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice, aren&#8217;t you&mdash;ashamed a bit to doubt
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221; She was looking at him now smilingly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt you. I know you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You fancy I refused point blank, without
waiting to tell you about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the third time the girl&#8217;s fingers crossed
and interlocked. That was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice!&#8221; The man moved over to her, paused
so, looking down into her face. &#8220;Tell me, I&#8217;m
dead in earnest. Don&#8217;t you trust me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I trust you absolutely, Steve; but that
doesn&#8217;t prevent my knowing you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I tell you I took the matter under
advisement.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He persuaded you to. You refused at first
even to consider it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Smilingly she returned his injured look fair in
the eyes. Still smiling, she watched him as in
silence he recrossed slowly to his place.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right&mdash;as usual,&#8221; he admitted
at last. &#8220;You do know me. Apparently all
my friends know me, better than I know myself.&#8221;
He shrugged characteristically. &#8220;But
you haven&#8217;t answered my question yet. What do
you think of my accepting?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I try never to think&mdash;about the useless.
You won&#8217;t accept.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You may be mistaken, may compel me to
against my best judgment.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t do that. I shan&#8217;t influence
you in the least.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For answer Armstrong stood up, his hands
deep in his pockets, his shoulders square. A minute
perhaps he stood so. Once he cleared his
throat. He sat down. An instant later he
laughed&mdash;naturally, in genuine amusement.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I surrender, Elice,&#8221; he said; &#8220;foot, horse,
and officers. I can succeed in deceiving myself,
easily; but when it comes to you&mdash;&#8221; He
dropped his hands hopelessly. &#8220;On the square,
though, and between ourselves, do you want me
to quit the University and accept this&mdash;job?
It&#8217;s a good lead, I realize.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not say either way,&#8221; slowly. &#8220;I
repeat that it&#8217;s useless to disagree, when nothing
would be gained.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Disagree! We never disagree. We never
have in all the time we&#8217;ve known each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We&#8217;ve never discussed things where disagreement
was probable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s right. I never thought of it
before.&#8221; A pause. &#8220;Has that harmony been
premeditated on your part?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unconsciously so, yes. It&#8217;s an instinct with
me, I think, to avoid the useless.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong stared across the dim light of the
porch. Mentally he pinched himself.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, I am dumb,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;and you
are wonderful. Let&#8217;s break the rule, though, for
once, and thresh this thing out. I want your
opinion on this Graham matter, really. Tell me,
please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; repeated the girl. &#8220;You&#8217;d
remember what I said&mdash;and it wouldn&#8217;t do any
good. Let&#8217;s forget it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Of course I&#8217;d remember. I want to remember,&#8221;
pressed the man. &#8220;You think I ought to
accept?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment the girl hesitated; then she looked
him fair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why? Tell me exactly why, please?
You&#8217;re not afraid to tell me precisely what you
think.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not afraid; but I think you ought to
realize it without my putting it in words.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong looked genuine surprise.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose I ought&mdash;probably it&#8217;s childishly
obvious, but&mdash;tell me, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To put it selfishly blunt, then, since you insist,
I think you ought to for my sake. If an income
you can depend upon means nothing in particular
to you you might consider what it would mean
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Unconsciously the lounging figure of the man
in the chair straightened itself. The drawl left
his voice.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Since we have stumbled upon this subject,&#8221;
he said quietly, &#8220;let&#8217;s get to the bottom of it.
I think probably it will be better for both of us.
Just what would it mean to you, that five thousand
dollars a year?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, Steve, without my telling
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps; but I&#8217;d rather you told me unmistakably.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As before the girl hesitated, longer this time;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
involuntarily she drew farther back until she was
completely hidden in the shadow.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What it means to me you can&#8217;t help knowing,
but I&#8217;ll repeat it if you insist.&#8221; She drew a
long breath. Her voice lowered. &#8220;First of all,
it would mean home, a home of my own. You
don&#8217;t know all that that means because you&#8217;re a
man, and no man really does understand; but
to a woman it&#8217;s the one thing supreme. You
think I&#8217;ve got one now, have had all my life; but
you don&#8217;t know. Father and I live here. We
keep up appearances the best we can; we both
have pride. He holds his position in the University;
out of charity every one knows, although
no one is cruel enough to tell him so. We manage
to get along somehow and keep the roof tight;
but it isn&#8217;t living, it isn&#8217;t home. It&#8217;s a perpetual
struggle to make ends meet. His time of usefulness
is past, as yours will be past when you&#8217;re his
age; and it&#8217;s been past for years. I never admitted
this to a human being before, but I&#8217;m
telling it to you because it&#8217;s true. We&#8217;ve kept
up this&mdash;fight for years, ever since I can remember,
it seems to me. We&#8217;ve never had income
enough to go around. I haven&#8217;t had a new dress
in a year. I haven&#8217;t the heart to ask for it.
Everything I have has been darned and patched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and turned until it won&#8217;t turn again. It isn&#8217;t
poverty such as they have on the East Side, because
it isn&#8217;t frank and open and aboveboard;
but it&#8217;s genteel poverty in the best street of the
town: University Row. It&#8217;s worse, Steve, because
it&#8217;s unadmitted, eternally concealed, hopeless.
It isn&#8217;t a physical hunger, but again a
worse one: an artistic hunger. I&#8217;m a college
graduate with letters on the end of my name
when I choose to use them. I&#8217;ve mixed with
people, seen the niceties of life that only means
can give, couldn&#8217;t help seeing them; and they&#8217;re
all beyond my reach, even the common ones. If
I didn&#8217;t know anything different I shouldn&#8217;t
feel the lack; but I do know. I&#8217;m not even to
blame for knowing. It was inevitable, thrust
upon me. I&#8217;m the hungry child outside the
baker&#8217;s window. I can look and look&mdash;and that
is all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The voice ceased. Frankly, unhesitatingly,
the face came out of the shadow and remained
there.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think you understand now what I mean,
Steve, unmistakably. I suppose, too, you think
me selfish and artificial and horrid, and I shan&#8217;t
deny it. I am as I am and I want things. To
pretend that I don&#8217;t would be to lie&mdash;and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
won&#8217;t lie to you whatever happens. I simply
won&#8217;t. We both know what your place in the
University means; I perhaps better than you,
because I&#8217;ve seen my father&#8217;s experience. I don&#8217;t
often get bitter, but I come very near it when I
look back and think how my mother had to plan
and scrimp. I feel like condemning the whole
University to the bottomless pit. I suppose Margery
Randall would resent it if I told her so, but
honestly I pity her; the more so because I&#8217;ve
always envied her in a way. She&#8217;s not used to
denying herself anything, and there&#8217;s bound to
be a reckoning. It&#8217;s inevitable, and then&mdash;I
don&#8217;t like to think of how it will be then. It&#8217;s a
tragedy, Steve, nothing more or less.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Opposite the man sat motionless in his place
looking at her. All trace of his usual lounging
attitude was absent. He was not even smoking.
For almost a full minute after she was done he
sat; then he arose abruptly. This time he did
not offer to come over to her.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So this is the way you feel,&#8221; he commented at
last, slowly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new phase of you entirely,
Elice, that I admit; but at least I&#8217;m glad to
know it.&#8221; He thrust his hands deep into his
pockets. &#8220;In plain English, you&#8217;d barter my
position and ambition gladly for&mdash;things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
Frankly I didn&#8217;t think that of you, Elice, before.
I imagined I knew you better, knew different.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Responsive, instinctively the girl started to rise.
Her breath came quick. Swiftly following came
second thought and she sank back, back into the
shadow. She said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment the man waited, expecting an answer,
a denial, something; when nothing came he
put on his hat with meaning deliberation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat I&#8217;m very glad you told me, though,
even if I do have to readjust things a bit.&#8221; He
shrugged his shoulders. Despite the wounded
egotism that was urging him on, it was the first
real cloud that had arisen on the horizon of their
engagement and he was acutely self-conscious.
&#8220;Rest assured, however, that I shall consider
your point of view before I say yes or no to
Graham. Just now&mdash;&#8221; He halted, cleared his
throat needlessly; abruptly, without completing
the sentence or giving a backward glance, he
started down the walk. &#8220;Good-night, Elice,&#8221; he
said.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>PLEASURE</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The trouble with you, Darley,&#8221; said Armstrong,
&#8220;is that you took your course in
the University in too big doses. You went on
the principle that if a little grinding is good for
a man a perpetual dig must be a great deal
better.&#8221; He was in the best of humor this Sunday
night, and smiled at the other genially. &#8220;A
college course is a good deal like strychnine.
Taken in small doses over a long period of time
it is a great tonic. Swallowed all at once&mdash;you
know what happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From her place in a big easy chair Elice
Gleason watched with interest the result of
the badinage, but Roberts himself made no
comment.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You started in,&#8221; continued Armstrong, &#8220;to
do six years&#8217; work in four&mdash;and did it. You
were a human grinding machine and you ground
very fine, that I&#8217;ll admit; but in doing so you
missed a lot that was more valuable, a lot that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
while it doesn&#8217;t make credit figures in the sum
total of university atmosphere.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For instance?&#8221; suggested the other, laconically.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, for one thing, you never joined a fraternity.
I know,&#8221; quickly, &#8220;that the frats are
abused, as every good thing is abused, but fundamentally
they&#8217;re good. When it comes to humanizing
a man, rounding him out, which is the
purpose of college life, they&#8217;re just as essential
as a course in the sciences.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unfortunately,&#8221; commented Roberts, drily,
&#8220;the attitude of a student to the Greeks is a good
deal like that of woman to man. She can&#8217;t marry
until she is asked. I was likewise never sufficiently
urged.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;In that case,&#8221; laughed Armstrong, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have to acquit you on that count. There wasn&#8217;t,
however, anything to prevent you warming up
socially. No student has to be asked to do that.
You and Elice, for instance, took your courses
at the same time. Normally you would have
met at social doings on a hundred occasions;
and still you have never really done so until
to-night, several years after you were graduated.
You can&#8217;t square yourself on that
score.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; acquiesced Roberts with judicial slowness;
&#8220;and still a man with one suit of clothes
and that decidedly frayed at the seams labors
under appreciable social disadvantages even in a
democratic university.&#8221; He smiled, a tolerant,
reminiscent smile. &#8220;I recall participating tentatively
a bit early in my career, but the result was
not entirely a success. My stock went below par
with surprising rapidity; so I took it off the
market.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong glanced at the listening girl swiftly.
Purposely he was trying to draw the other man
out&mdash;and for her benefit. But whatever the
girl was thinking her face was non-committal.
He returned to the attack.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right,&#8221; he shifted easily; &#8220;we&#8217;ll pass
charge number two likewise. One thing at least,
however, you&#8217;ll admit you could have done. You
might have taken up athletics. You were asked
often enough, I know personally&mdash;nature did a
lot for you in some things; and as for clothes&mdash;the
fewer you have in athletics the better. You
could have mixed there and warmed up to your
heart&#8217;s content. Isn&#8217;t it so?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time Roberts laughed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was engaged in athletics&mdash;all the time I
was in the University,&#8221; he refuted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The deuce you were! I never knew before&mdash;All
right, I bit. How was that, Darley?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Simple enough, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; drily. &#8220;I venture
the proposition that I sawed more wood and
stoked more furnaces during my course than any
other student that ever matriculated. I had four
on the string constantly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong sank back in his chair lazily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right, Darley,&#8221; he accepted; &#8220;when you
won&#8217;t be serious there&#8217;s no use trying to make
you so. I surrender.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Serious!&#8221; Roberts looked at the younger
man peculiarly. &#8220;Serious!&#8221; he echoed low.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just where your diagnosis fails, my
friend. It&#8217;s the explanation as well why I never
did those &#8216;other things,&#8217; as you call them, that
students do and so humanize themselves.&#8221; Involuntarily
his eyes went to the girl&#8217;s face, searched
it with a glance. &#8220;It is, I suppose, the curse
of my life: the fact that I can&#8217;t be different.
I seem to be incapable of digressing, even if
I want to.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For answer Armstrong smiled his sceptical
smile; but the girl did not notice. Instead, for
the first time, she asked a question.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you still think to digress, to enjoy oneself,
is not serious, Mr. Roberts?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, emphatically not. I&#8217;m human, I hope,
even if I haven&#8217;t been humanized. I think enjoyment
of life by the individual is its chief end.
It&#8217;s nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But you said&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; quickly; &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have
made myself clear then. We&#8217;re each of us a law
unto himself, Miss Gleason. What is pleasure
to me, perhaps, is not pleasure to you. I said I
was never asked to join a fraternity. It&#8217;s true.
It&#8217;s equally true, though, that I wouldn&#8217;t have
joined had I been asked. So with the social side.
I wouldn&#8217;t have been a society man if I&#8217;d had
a new dress suit annually and a valet to keep it
pressed. I simply was not originally bent that
way. Killing time, politely called recreation,
merely fails to afford me pleasure. For that reason
I avoid it. I claim no credit for so doing.
It&#8217;s not consecration to duty at all, it&#8217;s pure
selfishness. I&#8217;m as material as a steam engine.
My pleasure comes from doing things; material
things, practical things. For a given period of
time my pleasure is in being able to point to a
given object accomplished and say to myself:
there, &#8216;Darley, old man, you started out to
do it and you&#8217;ve done it.&#8217; Is that clear, Miss
Gleason?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And if you don&#8217;t accomplish it, what then?&#8221;
commented Armstrong.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I shall at least have tried,&#8221; returned the other,
carelessly. &#8220;I can call the attention of Saint
Peter to that fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong leaned back farther in his chair.
His eyes sought the ceiling whimsically.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That would naturally bring up the old problem,&#8221;
he philosophized, &#8220;of whether it were better
to attempt to do a thing and fail or not to make
the attempt and retain one&#8217;s self-confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In her place the girl shifted restlessly, as
though the digression annoyed her.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To return to the starting point,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you think the greatest pleasure in life is in
action, not in passive sensation? We lazy
folks&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; interrupted Armstrong, &#8220;but
I want to anticipate and enter an objection.
Some of us aren&#8217;t lazy. We&#8217;re merely economical
of our energies.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We lazy folks,&#8221; repeated the girl, evenly,
&#8220;are sometimes inclined to think differently.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time Roberts hesitated, his face a blank
as he studied the two before him. Just perceptibly
he leaned forward. His big hands closed
on the chair arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Are you really interested in hearing the definition
of pleasure as I have formulated it for
myself, Miss Gleason?&#8221; he asked; &#8220;I repeat, as
I have formulated it for myself?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Roberts hesitated, his face inscrutable,
his body motionless as one asleep.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pleasure,&#8221; he began low, &#8220;is power; conscious,
unquestionable, superior power. In a
small way we all experience it when we are
hungry and have the ability to satisfy that
hunger. The big animal feels it when the lesser
animal is within its reach and the big animal
knows it. The lover tastes it when he knows another
returns that love completely, irresistibly&mdash;knows,
I say. The student comprehends it when
he is conscious of ability to solve the problem
presented, to solve it unqualifiedly. The master
of men realizes it when those in his command
obey him implicitly; when his word is law. Pleasure
is not necessarily an exercise of that power,
in fact is not generally so; but it lies in the consciousness
of ability to exercise it at will. For
the big animal to annihilate the less would bring
pain, not pleasure. Hunger satisfied is passivity,
not pleasure. And so on down the list. Superior,
conscious power exercised defeats its own purpose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
It is, as men say, unsportsmanlike. Held
in reserve, passive, completely under control, it
makes of a human being a god. This to me is
pleasure, Miss Gleason.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment after he ceased speaking the
room was quiet. Armstrong still sat staring at
the ceiling; but the smile had left his lips. The
girl was watching the visitor frankly, the tiny
pucker, that meant concentration, between her
eyebrows. Roberts himself broke the silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard my definition, Miss Gleason,&#8221;
he laughed; &#8220;and no doubt think me a savage or
something of that kind. I shan&#8217;t attempt to
deny it if you do either. Just as a matter of curiosity
and of interest, though, so long as the subject
is up, I&#8217;d like to hear your own definition.&#8221;
Of a sudden he remembered. &#8220;And yours, too,
Armstrong,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The wrinkle vanished from the girl&#8217;s forehead.
She smiled in turn. An observer might have said
she sparred for time. &#8220;After you, Steve,&#8221; she
accepted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong shifted in his seat elaborately.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;This is indeed a bit sudden,&#8221; he remarked
in whimsical commonplace, &#8220;however&mdash;&#8221; His
hands went into his pockets automatically.
His eyes followed a seam on the paper overhead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
back and forth, before halting preparatorily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pleasure with me,&#8221; he began, &#8220;is not practical,
but very much the reverse.&#8221; His lips twitched
humorously. &#8220;Neither has it reference to any
superior power. I wouldn&#8217;t give one single
round penny, providing I had it, to be able to
whistle and have a thousand of my fellows dance
to the tune&mdash;against their wishes. If I could
whistle so sweetly or so enchantingly that they&#8217;d
caper nimbly because they wanted to, because the
contagion was irresistible, then&mdash;&#8221; The whimsical
look passed as suddenly as it had come.
&#8220;Pleasure with me, I think,&#8221; he continued soberly,
&#8220;means appreciation by my fellow-men, in
big things and in little things. I&#8217;m a kind of
sunflower, and that is my sun. I&#8217;d like to be able
to play marbles so well that the kids would stare
in amazement; to fashion such entrancing mud
pies that the little girls would want to eat them;
to play ball so cleverly that the boys would always
choose me first in making up sides; to dance so
divinely that the girls would dream about it afterward;
to tell so entertaining a story that men
would let their cigars go dead while they listened,
or under different circumstances the ladies would
split their gloves applauding&mdash;if they happened
to have them on; last of all, to write a novel so
different and interesting that the reading public,
and that means every one, would look on the
cover after they&#8217;d turned the last sheet to see
who the deuce did it; then trim the lamp afresh,
loosen their collar comfortably and read it
through again. This to me spells pleasure in
capitals all the way through: plain appreciation,
pure and simple, neither more nor less.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
<img src='images/illus-064.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 422px; height: 544px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 422px;'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of reading about life and hearing about life. I want to live it&#8221; (<i>Page 66</i>)<br />
</p>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again silence followed, but a far different
silence than before. Of that difference the three
in the room were each acutely conscious; yet no
one made comment. They merely waited, waited
until, without preface, the girl completed the tacit
agreement.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And pleasure to me,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;means
something different than it does to either of you.
In a way, with you both pleasure is active. With
me it&#8217;s passive.&#8221; She laughed shortly, almost
nervously. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m lazy, I don&#8217;t know;
but I&#8217;ve worked so long that I&#8217;m weary to death
of commonplace and repression and denial and&mdash;dinginess.
I want to be a free individual and
have leisure and opportunity to feel things, not
to do them. I&#8217;m selfish, hopelessly selfish, morbidly
selfish; but I am as I am. I&#8217;m like the
plant that&#8217;s raised in a cellar and can&#8217;t leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
because its roots are sunk there deep. I want to
be transplanted perforce out into the sunshine.
I&#8217;m hungry for it, hungry. I&#8217;ve caught glimpses
of things beyond through my cellar window, but
glimpses only. I repeat, I want to feel unhampered.
I know pretty things and artistic things
when I see them, and I want them: to wear, to
live among, to look at. I want to travel, to hear
real music, to feel real operas and know real plays&mdash;not
imitations. I&#8217;m tired of reading about
life and hearing about life. I want to live it, be a
part of it&mdash;not a distant spectator. That is
what pleasure means to me now; to escape the
tyranny of repression and of pennies and be free&mdash;free!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the third time silence fell; a silence that
lasted longer far than before, a silence which each
was loth to break. While she was speaking, at
first Armstrong had shifted about in his chair
restlessly; at the last, his hands deep in his
pockets, he had sat still. Once he had looked at
her, peculiarly, the tolerant half smile still on his
lips; but she had not returned the look, and bit
by bit it vanished. That was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a minute perhaps, until it became awkward
at least, the silence lasted&mdash;to be broken finally
by the girl herself. Slowly she arose from her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
seat and, tall, slender, deliberately graceful, came
from her place in the shadow into the light.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit ashamed to have brought out the
family skeleton and aired it to-night,&#8221; she said
evenly. Under drooping lids she looked from
one face before her to the other swiftly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know why I did it exactly. I&#8217;m a bit irresponsible,
I guess, to-night. We are all so, I think,
at times.&#8221; As deliberately as she did everything
she took a seat. Her hands folded in her lap.
&#8220;If you&#8217;ll forget it I&#8217;ll promise not to offend
in the same way again.&#8221; She smiled and changed
the subject abruptly. &#8220;I see by the papers,&#8221; she
digressed, &#8220;that at last we&#8217;re to have a trolley
line in town. The same authority informs us as
well that you are the moving spirit, Mr. Roberts.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; It was the ordinary laconic, non-committal
man of business who answered. A
pause, then a significant amplification. &#8220;This
is the age of the trolley. There are a hundred
miles of suburban lines contracted for as well.
No one will recognize this country as it is now
ten years hence.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And this suburban line you speak of&mdash;I suppose
you&#8217;re the spirit back of that too?&#8221; queried
the girl.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; This time there was no amplification.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So that was what you had in mind the
other night when we were talking,&mdash;what you
wouldn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; commented Armstrong, a
shade frostily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;One thing, yes.&#8221; Roberts ignored the tone
absolutely. &#8220;I was not at liberty to make the
announcement at that time. The deal was just
closed last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong made no further comment, but his
high spirits of the early evening had vanished
not to return, and shortly thereafter Roberts
arose to go. Promptly, seemingly intentionally
so, Armstrong followed. In the vestibule, his
hat in his hand, by design or chance he caught
the visitor&#8217;s eye.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me a moment,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;I&mdash;forgot
something.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Perforce Roberts waited while the other man
returned to the tiny library they had just vacated.
The girl was standing within precisely as when
they had left and, as Armstrong did not close the
door, the visitor knew to a certainty that his presence
as listener and spectator was intentional.
It was all a premeditated scene, the climax of the
evening.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By the way, Elice,&#8221; said the actor, evenly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been considering that Graham offer carefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
since I spoke to you about it the other
night.&#8221; He did not look at her but stood twirling
his hat judicially in his hand. &#8220;I tried to convince
myself that it was for the best to accept;
but I failed. I told him so to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There was a pause.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; suggested the girl.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Another pause.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not&mdash;disappointed, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still another pause, appreciable, though shorter
than before.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not disappointed,&#8221; replied the girl
then. At last Armstrong had glanced up and,
without looking himself, the listener knew as well
as though he had seen that the speaker was smiling
steadily. &#8220;I&#8217;m not disappointed in the least,
Steve.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>UNCERTAINTY</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was ten minutes after three on the following
afternoon when Stephen Armstrong, in the
lightest of flannels and jauntiest of butterfly ties,
strolled up the tree-lined avenue and with an air
of comfortable proprietorship wandered in at the
Gleason cottage. A movable sprinkler was playing
busily on the front lawn and, observing that
the surrounding sod was well soaked, with lazy
deliberation he shifted it to a new quarter. As
he approached the house a mother wren flitted
away before his face, and at the new suggestion
he stood peering up at the angle under the eaves
for the nest that he knew was near about. Once,
standing there with the hot afternoon sun beating
down upon him, he whistled in imitation of
the tiny bird&#8217;s call; nothing developing, he
mounted the steps and pulled the old-fashioned
knocker familiarly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There was no immediate response and he
pulled again; without waiting for an answer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
he dropped into the ever-convenient hammock
stretched beside the door and swung back and
forth luxuriously. Unconsciously, and for the
same reason that a bird sings&mdash;because it is carelessly
oblivious of anything save the happiness
of the moment&mdash;he began whistling softly to
himself: without definite time or metre, subconsciously
improvising. Perhaps a dozen times
he swung back and forth; then the whistling
ceased.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Anything doing at this restaurant this afternoon,
Elice?&#8221; he plunged without preface. An
expansive smile made up for the lack of conventional
greeting. &#8220;I&#8217;m as hungry as those little
wrens I hear cheeping up there somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The smile was contagious and the girl returned
it unconsciously.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re always hungry, Steve Armstrong,&#8221;
she commented.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know it. I was born that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you never grew up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Physically, yes, unfortunately. Otherwise&mdash;I&#8217;m
fighting to the last ditch. I believe about
three of those cookies you make&mdash;and, by the
way, they&#8217;re much better than mother used to
manufacture&mdash;will fill the void. Don&#8217;t you hear
that cheeping?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl hesitated, disappeared, and returned.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you, Elice. Sit down over there,
please, where I can see you. It makes them taste
better. That&#8217;s right. Thank you, again. I&#8217;m
going to pay my bill now by telling you your
fortune. You&#8217;re going to make a great cook.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said the girl, enigmatically.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s no question about it. And for good
measure I&#8217;m going to retail the latest gossip.
What, by the way and as a preliminary, do you
suppose I&#8217;ve been doing all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s vacation. Fishing, I presume.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Stung! I did go fishing this morning&mdash;four
o&#8217;clock, caught one too; but it was so small
and innocent looking that I apologized and threw
it back. That wasn&#8217;t what I referred to, however.
You&#8217;ll have to guess again.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m compelled to assist you then. I&#8217;ve been
helping the Randalls settle. Harry &#8217;phoned me
early this morning and wanted to know if I didn&#8217;t
desire to be useful; said he would exchange compliments
sometime.&#8221; A significant pause, then
a reminiscent sigh. &#8220;Every vertebra in my spinal
column aches with an individual and peculiar
pain.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They&#8217;re really settled at last, are they?&#8221; inquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
the girl, interestedly. &#8220;I can hardly wait
to see how things look.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you for being curious, Elice,&#8221;
sympathized Armstrong. &#8220;I felt a bit the same
way myself.&#8221; A rueful grin. &#8220;Merely among
ourselves, however, and as a word of advice between
friends, you&#8217;d better curb your impatience
for about a week longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why? You&#8217;re darkly mysterious, as
usual.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mysterious! Heavens, no; merely compassionate.&#8221;
He held up his hand for inspection.
&#8220;Look at that blister. It&#8217;s as big as a dime and
feels like a prune. They&#8217;re not done yet and
they&#8217;d induce you to duplicate it if they ever got
you into their clutches. So long as it&#8217;s all in the
family I think one blister is about sufficient.
Better lay low for a week anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve,&#8221; the voice was severe, &#8220;you&#8217;re simply
impossible. They&#8217;d never forgive you if they
knew you talked that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, they would,&#8221; easily. &#8220;I promised to
come back and help complete the job.&#8221; Of a
sudden he laughed boyishly, reminiscently.
&#8220;Seriously, Elice, I&#8217;ve had a memorable day.&#8221;
He laughed again. &#8220;Pardon me, but I&#8217;ve
wanted to do that for hours and didn&#8217;t dare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Such a mixture of furnishings as those two people
have accumulated you never saw brought together
under one roof before in your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mixture, how? I fail to see the joke.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You will when you visit them, all right. I
warn you in advance to be discreet.&#8221; He looked
at his companion with whimsical directness.
&#8220;You see it was this way. They started out
together to buy things, with Margery at the helm.
She&#8217;s not accustomed particularly to consider
cost and went at the job with avidity. She&#8217;s
methodical also, you know, and began at the
front door. In fancy she entered the reception
hall, and the first need that appealed to her was
a rug. She picked out one. It&#8217;s Oriental, and
a beauty: cost one hundred dollars if a cent.
Next, in her mind&#8217;s eye, she noticed the bare windows&mdash;curtains
were required, of course. So she
selected them. They&#8217;re the real thing and two
pairs&mdash;another hundred, I&#8217;ll wager. Following
came three or four big leather chairs&mdash;nothing
better in town. I can fancy old Harry&#8217;s heart
sinking by this time; but he didn&#8217;t say a word&mdash;yet.
Margery took another spurt and went
on to the living-room. In consequence another
big rug&mdash;and another hundred withdrawn from
circulation. A jolly big davenport&mdash;more curtains;&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
then something happened. They
told me so, but I didn&#8217;t need to be told; for it
was then that Harry butted in. They were bankrupt
already, and he knew it. He simply had to
call a halt. It&#8217;s the funniest contrast I ever saw,
and pathetic too; for from this point on the whole
house is a nightmare. Cheap! he bought the
cheapest things he could find and even then he
got scared. By the time they got through the
dining-room he must have been a nervous wreck,
for the kitchen and upstairs furniture is second-hand,
every stick and frying pan; and even
then&mdash;&#8221; The humor left the speaker&#8217;s face.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to make fun of it, though, Elice.
They&#8217;re going to replace it all as soon as they can.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment neither said anything.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And Margery?&#8221; suggested the girl at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s where the little tragedy crops out.
You see we began the way she had begun&mdash;at
the front door. She was pleased as a boy with
new boots at the reception hall. Still cheerful
over the living-room. Non-committal in the
diner. From there on Harry and I carted things
upstairs and juggled with them alone and according
to our own ideas.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the second time there was silence; then,
low-voiced, came another suggestion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And&mdash;Harry?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He&#8217;s game,&#8221; admiringly. &#8220;He may be thinking
a lot&mdash;I&#8217;ve no doubt he is; but he&#8217;s not letting
out a peep or making a sign. He pretended
Margery was just tired out and bundled her out
of doors under the trees. That&#8217;s one thing
they&#8217;ve got at least: a whole yard full of grandfather
elms. He sort of looked at me cross-eyed
while he was doing it to see if I caught on, but
I was blind as a post. By the way, I nearly forgot
to mention it, but you and I are invited there
for dinner this coming Thursday&mdash;sort of a
house-warming and appreciation of my efforts
combined.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For dinner, so soon?&#8221; The girl stared incredulously.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Margery ever
cooked a meal in her life.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She isn&#8217;t going to try to yet, she informed
me, so be of good cheer. That sort of thing is
all to come later on, with the replaced furniture.
At present she&#8217;s to have a maid and take observations.&#8221;
The speaker laughed characteristically.
&#8220;I asked her if she referred to the sort of
individual my mother used to call a hired girl,
but she stuck to &#8216;maid.&#8217; It seems they are to
pay her six dollars a week. Hired girls only
command four.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason joined in the laugh sympathetically.
The other&#8217;s good spirits was irresistible.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You seem to have been gathering valuable
data,&#8221; she commented drily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I have indeed. I couldn&#8217;t well help it. I
was even forced into the conviction that it was
intended I should so gather.&#8221; He smiled into his
companion&#8217;s eyes whimsically. &#8220;They&#8217;re deep,
those Randalls. After all is said I fancy my
assistance was acquired not so much from any
desire to save as to point a valuable object lesson;
scatter the contagion, as it were.&#8221; He paused
meaningly and smiled again. &#8220;Elice mine,
we&#8217;re in grave danger, you and I. That worthy
pair have designs upon our future. They are
in the position of a certain class, famed in adage,
who desire company. The dinner is only another
illustration of the same point.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason returned the smile, but quietly.
She made no further comment, however, and the
subject dropped.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the hammock Armstrong swung back and
forth in lazy well-being. Overhead the mother
wren, a mere brown shadow, flitted in return over
their heads. There was an instant&#8217;s clamor from
hidden fledglings, and silence as the shadow
passed back once more into the sunshine. Watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
through half-closed eyes, comfortably whimsical,
Armstrong gazed into space where the
shadow had vanished.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What a responsibility the care of a family
must be,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;particularly in this
hot weather. That wren certainly has my sympathy&mdash;and
respect.&#8221; He paused to give the
swinging hammock a fresh impulse. &#8220;I wonder
though,&#8221; he drifted on, &#8220;that is, if it is permissible
to tangle up a variety of thoughts, if it&#8217;s
any harder than it is to attempt to pull an idea
out of one&#8217;s self by the roots and work it up into
readable form with the thermometer above ninety
in the shade&mdash;I wonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason was observing him now, peculiarly,
understandingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How is the book coming, anyway, Steve?&#8221;
she asked directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Which book?&#8221; smilingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;<i>The</i> book, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They&#8217;re all <i>the</i> books&mdash;or were at one
time.&#8221; A trace, the first, of irony crept into his
voice. &#8220;To be specific, however, masterpiece
number one has just completed its eighteenth
round trip East, and is taking a deserved rest.
Masterpiece number two is <i>en route</i> somewhere
between here and New York, either coming or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
going, on its eleventh journey. Number three
has only five tallies to its credit&mdash;but hope
springs eternal. Number four, the baby, still
adolescent, has temporarily halted in its growth
while I succor a needy benedict friend in distress.
I believe that covers the family.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The characterization was typically nonsensical;
but, sympathetic, the listener read between
the sentences and understood.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the new one coming well?&#8221; she asked
low. &#8220;Tell me, Steve, honest.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Coming well, Elice! What a question to ask
of probably America&#8217;s foremost living writer!&#8221;
The speaker was still smiling. &#8220;What reprehensible
misgiving, suspicion even!&#8221; Sudden silence,
wherein bit by bit the smile faded. Silence
continued until in its place came a new expression,
one that changed the boy&#8217;s face absolutely,
made it a man&#8217;s face&mdash;and not a young one at
that.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Coming well, Elice?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Honest,
as you say, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; The hammock had
become still, but the speaker did not notice,
merely lying there looking up into the sunshine
and the blue unseeingly. &#8220;Sometimes I think
it is, and then again&mdash;if one could only know
about such things, know, not hope&mdash;of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
every writer in his own soul fancies&mdash;and his
friends, for that matter, are just about as useful&mdash;&#8221;
The speaker drew himself together with
a shrug. For an instant his jaw locked decisively.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know I&#8217;m more or less irresponsible, as a
rule, Elice,&#8221; he analyzed swiftly, &#8220;and probably
create the impression that I&#8217;m even more irresponsible
than I am; but in this thing, at least,
I&#8217;m serious. From the bottom of my soul I want
to write well, want to. As I said before, sometimes
I think I can&mdash;auto-intoxication maybe
it is, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;and I&#8217;m as happy as a
child, or a god, or a bird, or any completely happy
thing you can fancy. Then again, as it&#8217;s been
the past week, or the past month for that matter,
I don&#8217;t seem to be able to do anything new. On
top of this everything I&#8217;ve already done fairly
personifies and leers at me. I get so that I fairly
hate myself for the utter failure that I am, that
at least I have been so far. I get to analyzing
myself; I can&#8217;t help it, and the result isn&#8217;t
pleasant. I&#8217;ve been doing so lately. I don&#8217;t overestimate
myself in the least, Elice girl. Practically,
commercially, I&#8217;m a zero. I&#8217;m simply
not built that way. If I&#8217;m ever of any use in the
world, ever amount to anything whatever, it will
be in an impractical, artistic way. Whether I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
ever win out so&mdash;oh, for light, for light!...
Frankly, the new novel is going badly, Elice,
cursedly bad!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Steve. You know&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve believed always, and still believe&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know that too.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it in you to win; I know it, and
you know it. You&#8217;ve done good work already,
lots of it, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wade into him and lick him!&#8221; bitterly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s only three sizes larger than you are, and
afraid&mdash;I know you can lick him. Wade in!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Forgive me, Elice,&#8221; with quick contrition.
&#8220;That was nasty of me, I confess. But I&#8217;m
sore to-day, raw. It&#8217;s genius I suppose,&#8221; sarcastically,
&#8220;genius unappreciated.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still the girl said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If I could only get a ray of light, a lead, the
flutter of a signal from outside the wall. But I
keep hammering my head at it day after day,
and it remains precisely as it was years ago when
I began. It&#8217;s maddening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Yet the girl was silent, waiting silent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And, last of all, if I should eventually succeed,
should break through into my own, as Darley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Roberts says, even then&mdash;from any point
of view it isn&#8217;t a cheerful prospect.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As Mr. Roberts says? What was that,
Steve?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I referred to the reward, pecuniary reward.
He figured it out in dollars and cents once when
he wanted to bring me out of the clouds. Looking
at it that way, there isn&#8217;t much to the game
even for the winners, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not much if you win? I can&#8217;t believe it,
Steve. I always supposed&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Everybody does. The public, the uninitiated,
are long on supposing. Even the would-be&#8217;s
like myself delude themselves and build air castles
until some hard-headed friend calls the turn.
Then&mdash;no; there really isn&#8217;t much in it, Elice;
nothing in comparison to the plums in the business
world. That job of Graham&#8217;s, for instance,
offers greater possibilities than success even, and
when it comes to partial success or failure! It&#8217;s
a joke, the artistic temperament in this commercial
twentieth century, a tremendous side-splitting
joke! One nowadays should be born with suckers
on his fingers, such as a fly has on its feet, so that
whenever he came into the vicinity of a bank note
it would stick fast. That would be the ideal condition,
the greatest natural blessing, now!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know you don&#8217;t mean that, Steve. It&#8217;s
hot and you&#8217;re out of the mood to-day&mdash;that&#8217;s
all. To-morrow will be different; you&#8217;ll see
things straight again.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you, Elice. You&#8217;re right, as usual.
I said I was raw to-day. It&#8217;s boyish to be so
too, I realize that. But it&#8217;s hard sometimes,
deucedly hard, when others are doing something
and getting somewhere to see yourself standing
still. One gets to thinking and imagining things
that probably don&#8217;t exist.&#8221; He took a long
breath. &#8220;It&#8217;s this thing of imagination that&#8217;s
worse than reality. It crawls in between everything
so; and somehow you can&#8217;t keep it out.
It gives one a scare.&#8221; He laughed shortly, ill
at ease. &#8220;It even makes one doubt a little the
people one believes in most: take you and me, for
instance. In my sane moments I know nothing
could get between us; but sometimes I get to
imagining&mdash;times like the last few days when
I am&mdash;raw&mdash;that we&#8217;re gradually drifting
apart. A little difference of opinion comes up
and imagination magnifies until it becomes a
mountain and&mdash;I know I&#8217;m preposterous,
Elice, and there&#8217;s nothing really to it, but the
thing&#8217;s been on my mind and I wanted to tell
you and get it out of my system.&#8221; He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
hurried on, leading up to the point, making the
situation deliberately. Now he turned to her,
smiling frankly. &#8220;It&#8217;s preposterous, isn&#8217;t it,
Elice? Tell me so. I like to hear you say it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Preposterous, Steve?&#8221; The girl returned
the look, but for some reason, probably one she
herself could not have told, she did not smile. She
merely looked at him, steadily, unwaveringly.
&#8220;I have never thought of the possibility before,
never questioned. Certainly nothing has come
between us. To imagine&mdash;I never imagine the
unpleasant, Steve.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The figure in the hammock shifted restlessly,
as though but half satisfied.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And nothing ever will, Elice?&#8221; he pressed.
&#8220;Say that just to please me. I think an awful
lot of you, girl; so much that at times I&#8217;m
afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time the girl smiled, quietly, very quietly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I of you, Steve,&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;Must I
protest that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; swiftly, &#8220;not for an instant. I don&#8217;t
doubt, mind.... It&#8217;s all that cursed imagination
of mine. I was only thinking of the future.
If things shouldn&#8217;t come my way, shouldn&#8217;t&mdash;I
put it at the worst possible&mdash;if by any chance
I should remain a&mdash;failure such as I am now&mdash;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
wouldn&#8217;t mind&mdash;would overlook&mdash;it
wouldn&#8217;t make any difference at all with you
and me, would it, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve, you mustn&#8217;t say such things&mdash;mustn&#8217;t,
I say. It&#8217;s morbid. I won&#8217;t listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But tell me,&#8221; passionately, &#8220;what I asked.
I want to hear you say it. I want to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant the girl was silent, an instant
that seemed minutes to the expectant listener.
For the second time she met him eye to eye.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Whether or not you become famous as a
writer,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;won&#8217;t make any difference
in the least. It&#8217;s you I care for, Steve; you
as you are now and nothing more.&#8221; The voice
paused but the eyes did not shift. &#8220;As for the
future, Steve man, I can&#8217;t promise nor can you.
To do so would be to lie, and I won&#8217;t lie. I say
I love you; you as you are. If anything ever
should come between us, should, I say&mdash;you suggested
it and&mdash;persist&mdash;it will be because of a
change in you yourself.&#8221; For the second time
she halted; then she smiled. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s all
there is to say,&#8221; she completed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All!&#8221; With a buoyancy unfeigned the man
swung out of the hammock upon his feet.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just the beginning. You&#8217;re just getting
under way, Elice.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; peremptorily; &#8220;all&mdash;for the present
at least. It&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock of the afternoon, you
know, and the neighbors have eyes like&mdash;Look
at the sun shine!... You&#8217;ve scared away the
wren too, and the brood is hungry. Besides it&#8217;s
time to begin dinner. Cooks shouldn&#8217;t be hindered
ever.&#8221; She turned toward the door decisively.
&#8220;You may stay if you don&#8217;t bother
again,&#8221; she smiled over her shoulder. &#8220;Meanwhile
there&#8217;s a new &#8216;Life&#8217; and a July &#8216;Century,&#8217;&mdash;you
know where,&#8221; and with a final smile she
was gone.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>CERTAINTY</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Four months had drifted by; again the
University was in full swing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Of an evening in late October at this time, in
the common living-room which joined the two
private rooms in the suite occupied by himself
and Darley Roberts, Stephen Armstrong was
alone. It was now nearly eleven o&#8217;clock, and he
had come in directly after dinner, ample time to
have prepared his work for the next day; but as
yet he had made no move in that direction. On
the roll-top desk, with its convenient drop light,
was an armful of reference books and two late
scientific magazines. They were still untouched,
however, bound tight by the strap with which
they had been carried.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
But one sign of his prolonged presence was
visible in the room. That, a loose pile of manuscript
alternately hastily scribbled and painfully
exact, told of the varying moods under which it
had been produced;&mdash;that and a tiny pile of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
cigarette stumps in the nearby ash-tray, some
scarcely lit and others burned to a tiny stump,
which had become the manuscripts&#8217; invariable
companion.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For more than an hour now, however, he had
not been writing. The night was frosty and he
had lit the gas in the imitation fireplace. The
open flame had proved compellingly fascinating
and, once stretched comfortably in the big Turkish
rocker before it, duty had called less and less
insistently and there he had remained. For half
an hour thereafter he had scarcely stirred; then,
without warning, he had risen. On the mantel
above the grate was a collection of articles indigenous
to a bachelor&#8217;s den: a box half filled
with cigars, a jar of tobacco, a collection of pipes,
a cut-glass decanter shaded dull red in the electric
light. It was toward the latter that he turned,
not by chance but with definite purpose, and without
hesitation poured a whiskey glass level full.
There was no attendant siphon or water convenient
and he drank the liquor raw and returned the
glass to its place. It was not the quasi-æsthetic
tippling of comradery but the deliberate drinking
of one with a cause, real or fancied, therefor and
for its effect; and as he drank he shivered involuntarily
with the instinctive aversion to raw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
liquor of one to whom the action has not become
habitual. Afterward he remained standing for
a moment while his eyes wandered aimlessly
around the familiar room. As he did so his glance
fell upon the pile of text-books, mute reminder
of a lecture yet unprepared, and for an instant
he stood undecided. With a characteristic shrug
of distaste and annoyance, of dismissal as well,
he resumed his seat, his slippered feet spread wide
to catch the heat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Another half-hour passed so, the room silent
save for the deliberate ticking of a big wall clock
and the purr of the gas in the grate; at last came
an interruption: the metallic clicking of a latch
key, the tramp of a man&#8217;s feet in the vestibule,
and Darley Roberts entered. A moment after
entering the newcomer paused attentive, his
glance taking in every detail of the all too familiar
scene; deliberately, as usual, he hung up his
top-coat and hat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Taking it comfortable-like, I see,&#8221; he commented
easily as he pulled up a second chair
before the grate. &#8220;Knocked off for the evening,
have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Knocked off?&#8221; Armstrong shrugged. &#8220;I
hardly know. I haven&#8217;t knocked on yet. I&#8217;m
stuck in the mud, so to speak.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts drew the customary black cigar from
his waistcoat pocket and clipped the end methodically.
As he did so, apparently by chance, his
glance swept the mantel above the grate, and,
returning, took in the testimony of the desk
with its unopened text-books and pile of scattered
manuscript. Equally without haste he lit
a match and puffed until the weed was well
aglow.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Any assistance a friend can give?&#8221; he proffered
directly. &#8220;We all get tangled at times, I
guess. At least every one I know does.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong&#8217;s gaze left the fire and fastened on
his companion peculiarly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you yourself?&#8221; he asked bluntly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Often.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s news. I fancied you were immune.
What, if I may ask, do you do at such times to
effect your release?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Go to bed, ordinarily, and sleep while the mud
is drying up. There&#8217;s usually a big improvement
by morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And when there isn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts smiled, the tight-jawed smile of a
fighter.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of pull, then; a pull as though
Satan himself were just behind and in hot pursuit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Things are bound to give if one pulls hard
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong&#8217;s face returned to the grate. His
slippered feet spread wider than before.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not much good at pulling,&#8221; he commented.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts sat a moment in silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, if I can be of any assistance&mdash;&#8221;
he commented. &#8220;No butting in, you understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I understand, and thank you sincerely.
I doubt if you can help any though&mdash;if any one
can. It&#8217;s the old complaint mostly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Publishers who fail to appreciate, I gather.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Partly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And what more, may I ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong stretched back listlessly, his eyes
half closed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Everything, it seems, to me to-night, every
cursed thing!&#8221; Restless in spite of his seeming
inertia he straightened nervously. His fingers,
slender almost as those of a woman, opened and
closed intermittently. &#8220;First of all, the manuscript
of my new book came back this morning,
the one I&#8217;ve been working on for the last year.
The expressman delivered it just after you left.
That started the day wrong. Then came a succession
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
of little things. Breakfast, with coffee
stone-cold, and soggy rolls; I couldn&#8217;t swallow
a mouthful. Afterward I cut myself shaving,
and I was late for lecture, and there was no styptic
in the house, and I got down to my class with a
collar looking as though I&#8217;d had my throat cut.
The lecture room was chilly, beastly chilly, and
about half the men had colds. Every twentieth
word I&#8217;d say some one would sneeze and interrupt.
On top of this one chap on the front row
had neglected to complete his toilet and sat there
for half an hour manicuring his nails, every
blessed one of the ten; I counted them, while I
was trying to explain proximal principles. At
noon we had some more of that abominable soup
with carrots in it. Carrots! I detest the name
and the whole family; and we&#8217;ve had them every
day now for a week. After lunch another big
thing. I&#8217;d applied for position as lecturer in the
summer school, applied early. The president
met me to-day and remarked casually, very casually,
that the man for the place had already been
selected. He was very sorry of course, but&mdash;Back
at the department I found that Elrod, one
of my assistants, was sick, and of necessity I had
to take his place in the laboratory. Inside half
an hour some bumpkin dropped an eight-ounce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
bottle of sulphuretted hydrogen. It spattered
everywhere&mdash;and the smell! I feel like holding
my nose yet. Later the water got stopped up,
and for love or money no plumber&mdash;&#8221; The
speaker paused, his shoulders lifted eloquently.
&#8220;But what&#8217;s the use of itemizing. It&#8217;s been the
same all day long, one petty rasp after another.
To cap the climax Elice is out of town. She&#8217;s
got an English class in a high-school in a dinky
little burg out about twenty miles and goes out
there every Thursday. I forgot this was the day
until I pulled the knocker. That&#8217;s all, I guess,
except that I&#8217;m here.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts smiled, the deliberate smile of tolerant
understanding.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;One of those days, wasn&#8217;t it,&#8221; he commented
sympathetically.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; shortly, &#8220;and it seems lately as though
that was the only kind I had&mdash;seems as though
it was not one but an endless succession.... It&#8217;s
all so petty, so confoundedly petty and irritating,
and the outlook for the future seems so similar.&#8221;
Of a sudden the speaker arose, selected a bit of
rice paper from the mantel, and began rolling a
cigarette swiftly. The labor complete he paused,
the little white cylinder between his fingers. A
moment he stood so, irresolute or intentionally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
deliberate; without apology or comment he
poured a second glass of liquor even full from the
red decanter and drank it in silence. &#8220;On the
square, Darley,&#8221; he blazed, &#8220;I expected a lot
from that last book, banked on it; and it&#8217;s gone
flat, like the others.&#8221; He resumed his seat and
the cigarette flamed. &#8220;I worked hard on it,
did my level best. I don&#8217;t believe I can ever
do any better&mdash;and now it&#8217;s failed miserably.
It knocks my pins clean out from under
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a time the room was quiet. Roberts did
not smile this time, or offer sympathy. The
occasion for that had gone by. He merely
waited in the fulness of knowledge, until the
first hot flood of resentment had cooled, until the
inevitable reaction that followed was on. Deliberate,
direct to the point, he struck.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re satisfied I&#8217;m your friend, are you?&#8221;
he asked abruptly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The other looked his surprise.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Emphatically, yes. One of the few I have&mdash;it
seems to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I couldn&#8217;t possibly have any selfish
motive in&mdash;in tearing you loose from your moorings?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;None whatever that I can imagine. Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You won&#8217;t take offence either if I advise
plainly?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not a fool&mdash;yet. What is it, Darley,&mdash;your advice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Roberts paused, deliberately now, unemotionally.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;My advice then is to chuck it, for to-day and
to-morrow and all time: the University, this
whole artistic rainbow, chuck it as though it were
hot, red hot, and get down to earth. Is that brutally
plain enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Unconsciously Armstrong had sat up, expectant.
A moment he remained so, taking in the
thought, all its implications, its suddenly suggested
possibilities; as the full revolutionary significance
of the idea came home of a sudden he
dropped back in his place. With an effort he
smiled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To answer your question: yes, I think that
is brutally frank enough,&#8221; he said. A moment
longer he remained quiet, thinking, the idea expanding.
&#8220;Chuck it,&#8221; he repeated half to himself.
&#8220;It sounds sensible certainly, to-night
particularly.&#8221; New thoughts came, thoughts like
the sifting of dead ashes. &#8220;Chuck it,&#8221; feverishly,
&#8220;and admit incompetency, cowardice, failure absolute!&#8221;
For the third time he was on his feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
&#8220;No, never. I&#8217;ll go to the devil first.&#8221; His
fingers were on the red decanter, his brown eyes
aflame. &#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Armstrong!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No answer, although the fingers halted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still no answer; but bit by bit the hand
retreated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve,&#8221; repeated, &#8220;sit down, please; please,
I say. Let&#8217;s talk this matter over a little rationally.
People have changed their minds before,
some few billions of them&mdash;and made good
afterward too. Have a little patience, man, and
sit down. I have a proposition to make to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Reluctantly Armstrong obeyed. His face was
still unnaturally pale and he was breathing hard,
but he obeyed. Back in his seat he waited a second,
uncertain; with an effort he faced his companion
fairly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&mdash;realize I&#8217;m an ass, Darley,&#8221; he began,
hesitantly, &#8220;and that this sort of thing is melodramatically
cheap.&#8221; The white had left his face
now and words were coming more easily. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t attempt to apologize, I just simply admit
the truth. I&#8217;ve lost my grip this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Forget it.&#8221; The voice was commonplace.
&#8220;Just forget it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I can&#8217;t; I&#8217;m not built that way; but I wish
you would. If there&#8217;s one thing I hate more
than another it&#8217;s cheap heroics.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know it&mdash;and understand. Let it go at
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you. All right.&#8221; It was matter of
fact, but such with an effort. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hear your
proposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As usual Roberts wasted no preface.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The suggestion is merely in line with what I
said before. In so many words, it&#8217;s to throw up
this place of yours in the University and get into
business. You&#8217;ll come into contact with realities
that way and realities are eternally opposed to&mdash;cobwebs.
You&#8217;ll be happier and more contented,
I&#8217;m positive, once you get adjusted.&#8221;
He gave his listener a keen look. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an
opening in mind right now. Say the word and
I&#8217;ll have the place ready for you the day they
appoint your successor in the University. Do
you care to consider it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Consider, yes, certainly.&#8221; Armstrong had
lit a pipe and puffed at it shortly. &#8220;It&#8217;s white
of you too to offer it. I know it&#8217;s a good thing
or you wouldn&#8217;t make the suggestion.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s not as good as Graham&#8217;s offer,&#8221; refuted
the other evenly, &#8220;places like that don&#8217;t dangle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
loose every day; but it will pay you better than
a university chair, and it offers possibilities&mdash;you
anticipate probably,&mdash;it&#8217;s in connection with
the new electric line. Between ourselves, Armstrong,
this system is going to be a big thing
when it&#8217;s complete. This is a straight tip. I
happen to be in a position to know. I also happen
to be in position to put you very near the
basement, providing you wish to come in with
us unhampered.&#8221; The voice halted meaningly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m at liberty to say now, until you
are really in and prove unmistakably&mdash;I&#8217;ll have
several things more to tell you then.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, Darley,&#8221; he said
slowly, &#8220;or take offence, please; but&mdash;but, to
scrape off the veneer, you don&#8217;t trust me very far
even yet, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There was a moment of silence, time for second
thought.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I can&#8217;t misunderstand what you mean,&#8221; said
Roberts; &#8220;but unfortunately there are others besides
yourself for me to consider.&#8221; The voice
was patient, unnaturally so. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already
talked more than I should.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If I accepted,&#8221; unobservant, Armstrong&#8217;s
mind was running on in its own channel, &#8220;the
place you mean would take my entire time. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
a way it would be like Graham&#8217;s offer. I&#8217;d be
compelled&mdash;you catch the idea, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; This time the other did not amplify.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know why I refused that proposition
before. We beat the brush pretty thoroughly
at that time.&#8221; It was declination involved, but
declination nevertheless unmistakable. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
rocky road I&#8217;m on, and with occasional mudholes
such as&mdash;well&mdash;such as I fell into to-night;
but somehow I can&#8217;t leave it. I won&#8217;t
try to defend it this time. I&#8217;m not in the mood.
But when it comes to breaking free, taking a new
trail&mdash;I simply can&#8217;t do it, can&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well.&#8221; The voice was non-committal.
Waiting, Armstrong thought there would be
more to follow, a comment at least; but there was
none. Roberts merely leaned back more comfortably
in his place, remained so for a minute
while like smoke the former subject faded from
the horizon. Armstrong grew conscious that he
was being observed intently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By the way,&#8221; introduced Roberts, abruptly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to give up my residence here
in the suburbs. They&#8217;re remodelling the office
building I&#8217;m in, you know: adding another
floor, an elevator, and one thing and another.
I&#8217;ve rented a suite in the addition, to be fitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
out after some ideas of my own. They&#8217;ll begin
on it inside a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment Armstrong said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not particularly surprised,&#8221; he commented
at last, &#8220;that is, not surprised that you&#8217;re
going to quit me. It was merely a question of
time until this place we&#8217;re living in here got too
small for you. When will you go?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The lease gives them a month to deliver.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A month. All right.&#8221; There was frost
forming in the tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try and lassoo another
mate in that time. The place isn&#8217;t particularly
pretentious, but, nevertheless, I can&#8217;t afford
to inhabit it alone.&#8221; He smiled, but it was not
his customary companionable smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re
on the incline and trudging up steadily, aren&#8217;t
you, old man?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant Roberts returned the look with
the analytic one Armstrong knew so well.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I trust so,&#8221; he returned. A pause, again
sufficient for second thought. &#8220;Looking into the
immediate future I see a lot of grinding to be
done, and I need machinery to do it with. This
down town move is merely part of the campaign.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I see,&#8221; Armstrong ignored the explanation,
even perverted it intentionally. &#8220;And the next
installation of machinery will be in stone out on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Nob Hill among the other imitation colonial
factories. When&#8217;s that to be, if I may ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;When&#8217;s it to be, Darley?&#8221; repeated Armstrong.
&#8220;You have it in mind, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time Roberts turned, his eyes unsmiling,
his lips tight.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;When have I offended you, and how, Armstrong?&#8221;
he countered directly. &#8220;Tell me that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Offended!&#8221; Roused out of his ill humor
Armstrong flushed penitently. &#8220;You&#8217;ve never
offended, never. On the contrary, you&#8217;re only
too patient with my tantrums.&#8221; He jerked himself
together impulsively. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean anything
by that at all. I&#8217;m blooming glad to see
you prosper. I always knew you would.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The imitation colonial&mdash;factory then&mdash;&#8221;
Roberts recalled slowly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just a dream, a fancy, an air castle.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, a reality&mdash;I hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What?&mdash;a miracle! But how about the
tape line?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat: I hope. Hope always refers to the
future&mdash;the indefinite future.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong smiled broadly, shrugged. Banter
tingled on the tip of his tongue, but for some
reason remained unspoken. Abruptly as it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
arisen the subject vanished beneath the surface.
Merely the memory of that suggestion of things
to come remained.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the silence Roberts glanced at the clock and
arose preparatory to bed. Watching the familiar
action, a new thought sprang full-fledged to
Armstrong&#8217;s brain, a sudden appreciation of the
unconscious dependence he had grown to feel on
the other man. The thought took words.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;On the square, old man,&#8221; he said soberly, &#8220;I
hate to have you go. It&#8217;ll be beastly lonely here
without you to sit down on me and make me feel
foolish.&#8221; He gestured in mute eloquence. &#8220;It
means the end between you and me the moment
you pack your trunk. We may both put up a
bluff&mdash;but just the same it&#8217;s the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts halted thoughtfully where he stood.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The end? I wonder&mdash;and who will be to
blame?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Neither of us,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;It was inevitable.
We&#8217;ll simply drift apart. You recall I prophesied
once before&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I recall.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong started involuntarily. Another
memory had intruded.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You remember&mdash;something else I predicted,
do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A slow smile formed on Roberts&#8217; lips.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You said that sometime we&#8217;d hate each other,
in the same measure that we were friends now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; and it&#8217;s so. I feel it; why I don&#8217;t
know, can&#8217;t imagine&mdash;yet. But it will come
about as surely as to-morrow will come.&#8221; He
looked at his companion steadily, unsmilingly
prophetic. &#8220;Good-bye, friend Darley Roberts.
You&#8217;re going&mdash;and you won&#8217;t return. Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant Roberts stood as he was, motionless;
then he turned swiftly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re morbid to-night, Armstrong,&#8221; he
returned slowly. &#8220;In the morning the sun will
shine and the world will look very different. As
for my leaving&mdash;you&#8217;ll find another man who&#8217;ll
make a lot better mate than I am. I&#8217;m not a
good fellow in the least.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know it,&#8221; bluntly. &#8220;That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re
good for me.&#8221; Unconsciously his glance travelled
to the mantel, and shifted hurriedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a kind of clinging vine, I guess. To change the
figure of speech, I need a stiff rudder to keep me
headed straight to windward. I&#8217;ll&mdash;miss you,&#8221;
simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts hesitated a moment, choosing his words
carefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We can&#8217;t very well always be together,
though,&#8221; he suggested at last slowly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, we can&#8217;t. I realize it. It&#8217;s&mdash;Pardon
an ass and go to bed, old man.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For perhaps half a minute Roberts stood there,
the fire from the open grate lighting his face, his
big capable hands loose at his sides. He made no
motion to leave, nor for a space to speak; characteristically
abrupt, he turned, facing his companion
directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Armstrong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t work up to
things delicately and have them seemingly happen
by chance. Nature didn&#8217;t endow me with
that ability. I have to come out with a broadside
shot or not at all. I&#8217;m going to do so now. Why
don&#8217;t you get married? Miss Gleason will be a
better rudder immeasurably than I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Involuntarily Armstrong flushed, slowly the
color faded. He said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know I&#8217;m intruding and offending,&#8221; went
on the other; &#8220;you show that, but you said a bit
ago I was your friend and the thing is on my
mind. Believe this at least: I was never more
your friend than when I advise the move now.
I repeat: why don&#8217;t you get married, at
once?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why? You know why, Darley. It&#8217;s the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
old reason&mdash;the butcher, the baker, and the
candlestick maker. They still hold the fort.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not for you&mdash;unless you let them. Forgive
another broadside. If you get pinched temporarily
let a friend be of service. I&#8217;m not afraid
to trust you. Anyway I chance it. We all have
to chance something for happiness. Don&#8217;t delay
any longer, man, don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t?&#8221; Of a sudden Armstrong glanced
up and met the other&#8217;s look steadily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t?&#8221;
he repeated. &#8220;Why do you say that, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A second Roberts met the lifted questioning
eyes.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Because I meant it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t
ask me to say more.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But I do ask it,&#8221; pressed Armstrong, stubbornly.
&#8220;You meant something particular by
that, something I have the right to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you consider what I suggested,&#8221;
asked Roberts in a low tone; &#8220;merely consider
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps after you tell me what you meant.
Why &#8216;don&#8217;t,&#8217; please?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
On the cosy room fell silence,&mdash;the silence
of midnight; the longest silence of that interrupted
understanding. For a long while Roberts
stood precisely as he was; he started walking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
measuring the breadth of the room and back
again; something the watcher had never known
him to do before, never in the years of acquaintance,
no matter what the uncertainty or difficulty
confronting. A second time he followed
the trail back and forth, until, watching him, the
spectator felt at last something like terror of
the thing he had deliberately conjured and that
now was inevitably coming very near; for at
last Roberts had halted, was standing over him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;In all the time that I&#8217;ve known you, Armstrong,&#8221;
said a voice, a new voice, &#8220;you&#8217;ve asked
my advice repeatedly, asked the reason for it,
insisted that I explain minutely, and disregarded
it absolutely. I&#8217;ve tried to be honest with you
each time, tried to be of service; and still you&#8217;ve
disregarded. It&#8217;s been the same to-night, the
old, old story. I&#8217;ve been dead in earnest, tried
to be unselfish, and still you question and doubt
and insist.&#8221; A second the voice halted, the
speaker glancing down, not analytically or
whimsically, as usual, but of a sudden icy cold.
&#8220;You insist now, against my request, and once
more I&#8217;m going to humor you. You wish to
know what I meant by &#8216;don&#8217;t&#8217; delay. I meant
just this, man, just this and no more: Chances
for happiness come to us all sometime in our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
lives. They knock at our door and wait for us
to open. Sometimes, not often, they knock
twice; but they don&#8217;t keep on knocking forever.
There are a multitude of other doors in the
world and, after a while, opportunity, our opportunity,
goes by, and never returns; no matter
how loudly we call. Is that clear enough,
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;In the abstract, yes.&#8221; Armstrong&#8217;s lips
were dry and he moistened them unconsciously.
&#8220;In the concrete, though, as it applies to my&mdash;happiness&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;God, you&#8217;re an egotist, Armstrong! Is it
possible you can&#8217;t understand, or won&#8217;t?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Slowly, with an effort, Armstrong arose; his
face of a sudden gray, his hands fastened to the
back of his chair.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean to suggest that Elice,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;that Elice&mdash;You dare to suggest that to
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Dare?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
They looked at each other, not three feet
apart.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Dare?&#8221; Roberts repeated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve argued, advised, used persuasion&mdash;everything.
Take that as a warning if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
you wish, or disregard it if you choose. I&#8217;m
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
On the chair back the fingers locked tighter
and tighter, until they grew white. Tardy
comprehension was coming at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean to warn me,&#8221; Armstrong scarcely
recognized his own voice, &#8220;that you yourself&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I myself. That&#8217;s why I warned you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You yourself,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;whom I introduced
and took with me as my friend, my best
friend&mdash;you&mdash;Judas!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Re-introduced.&#8221; Roberts&#8217; eyes were as
steady as his voice. &#8220;Re-introduced&mdash;mark
that. Miss Gleason has forgotten, but she was
the first girl I met in the University, when I
had one suit of frayed clothes to my name, and
my stock was below par. Miss Gleason has
forgotten, I say, had no reason to remember;
but I&mdash;Nor&mdash;Judas; drop that for all
time.... I&#8217;ve warned you, you understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No&mdash;Roberts. I&#8217;m no hypocrite. You&#8217;ve
precipitated this understanding, compelled it;
but perhaps it&#8217;s as well. I&#8217;ll move out of here
to-morrow instead of in a month, if you wish.
Do you wish it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Bit by bit the hands on the chair back, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
had been so tense, loosened, and Armstrong
sank back in his seat, his face turned away.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;yet.&#8221; His fingers were
twitching aimlessly. &#8220;I want to think....
You, of all men, you!&#8221; He turned, his eyes
ablaze, his voice thick. &#8220;Yes, go to-morrow,
damn you! and as for your warning, do as you
please, get between us if you can.&#8221; He laughed
raspingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll delay&mdash;dangle, you catch that&mdash;as
long as I see fit. I dare you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant Roberts stood as he was; slowly
and without a word he started for his room.
As he did so Armstrong arose swiftly and, all
but gropingly, his hand sought the red decanter
on the mantel. &#8220;I dare you,&#8221; he repeated
blindly, &#8220;dare you!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Armstrong!&#8221; Roberts had halted, looking
back. &#8220;Not for any one&#8217;s sake but your own&mdash;think
a second, man.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To hell with you and thought!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Without a sound this time or another glance
the door to Roberts&#8217; room opened and closed
and Armstrong was alone.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A WARNING</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
With a dexterity born of experience
Harry Randall looked up from his
labor of separating the zone of carbon from the
smaller segment of chop that had escaped the
ravages of a superheated frying-pan and smiled
across the table at his wife.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; he said, refuting a pessimistic
observation previously made by the person
addressed, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re doing fine. I
can see a distinct improvement every month.
On the whole you&#8217;re really becoming an admirable
cook.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Undoubtedly!&#8221; The voice dripped with
irony. &#8220;That very chop, for instance&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Is merely a case in point,&#8221; amiably. &#8220;Some
people, unscientific people, might contend that
it was overdone; but the initiated&mdash;that&#8217;s us&mdash;know
better. Meat, particularly from the
genus hog, should always be well cooked. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
obviates the possibility of trichina infection
absolutely.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And those biscuits,&#8221; equivocally. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
wager they&#8217;d sink like steel billets.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Her husband inspected the articles designated
with a judicial eye.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Better so. We&#8217;re thus saved the temptation
of eating them. All statistics prove that
hot biscuits and dyspepsia&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The salad, then,&#8221; wearily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Hygienic beyond a doubt. The superabundance
of seasoning to which you doubtless refer
may be unusual; nevertheless, it&#8217;s a leaning in
the right direction. Condiments of all kinds
tend to stimulate the flow of the gastric juice;
and that, you know, from your physiology, is
what does the digestive business.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Margery Randall laughed, against her will.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And last of all the coffee,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Frankly, as coffee, it is a little peculiar; but
considered as hot water merely, it leaves nothing
to be desired; and science teaches again
that, like condiments, hot water&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The two laughed together; temporarily the
atmosphere cleared.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Seriously, Harry,&#8221; asked the girl, &#8220;do you
really think I&#8217;ll ever get so I can cook things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
that aren&#8217;t an insult?&#8221; She swept the indigestible
repast between them with a hopeless
look. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying my best, but at times like
this I get discouraged.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly you will,&#8221; with conviction. &#8220;Now
this bread, for instance,&#8221; he held up a slice
to illustrate, &#8220;is as good as any one can
make.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And unfortunately was one of the few
things that I didn&#8217;t make. It&#8217;s bakery bread,
of course, silly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall dropped the offending staff of life
as though it were hot.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;These cookies, then.&#8221; He munched one with
the pleasure of an epicure. &#8220;They&#8217;re good
thoroughly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice Gleason baked them for me to-day,&#8221;
icily. &#8220;She was here all the afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant of silence followed; glancing half
sheepishly across the board Randall saw something
that made him arise from his seat
abruptly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Margery, little girl,&#8221; his arms were around
her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take it so seriously. It&#8217;s all a
joke, honest.&#8221; With practised skill he kissed
away the two big tears that were rapidly gathering.
&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ll learn; every one has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
to have practice; and it&#8217;s something you never
did before, something entirely new.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s just the point,&#8221; repeated the girl.
The suddenly aroused tears had ceased to flow,
but she still looked the image of despondency.
&#8220;It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve never had to do, and I&#8217;ll
never learn. I&#8217;ve been trying for practically
a year now and things get worse and worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not worse,&#8221; hopefully; &#8220;you merely think
so. You&#8217;re just a bit discouraged and tired
to-night&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know it and, besides, I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221; She
was winking hard again against two fresh tears.
&#8220;I spoiled two cakes this afternoon. Elice tried
to show me how to make them; and I burned
my finger&#8221;&mdash;she held up a swaddled member
for inspection&mdash;&#8220;horribly. I just can&#8217;t do this
housework, Harry, just simply can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, you can.&#8221; Once more the two teary
recruits vanished by the former method. &#8220;You
can do anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl shook her head with a determination
premeditated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I repeat that I&#8217;ve tried, and it&#8217;s been
a miserable failure. I&mdash;think we&#8217;ll have to
have the maid back again, for good.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The maid!&#8221; Randall laughed, but not so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
spontaneously as was normal. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want
a maid bothering around, Margery. We want
to be alone.&#8221; He had a brilliant thought, speedily
reduced to action. &#8220;How could I treat injured
fingers like this properly if there was a
maid about?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be any burned fingers
then,&#8221; refuted the girl. Intentionally avoiding
the other&#8217;s look, she arose from the neglected
dinner-table decisively and, the man following
slowly, led the way to the living-room. &#8220;Joking
aside,&#8221; she continued as she dropped into a convenient
seat, &#8220;I mean it, seriously. I&#8217;ve felt
this way for a long time, and to-day has been
the climax. I simply won&#8217;t spend my life cooking
and dusting and&mdash;and washing dishes.
Life&#8217;s too short.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From out the depths of the big davenport
Harry Randall inspected steadily the rebellious
little woman opposite. He did not answer at
once, it was not his way; but he was thinking
seriously. To say that the present moment was
a surprise would be false. For long, straws had
indicated the trend of the wind, and he was not
blind. There was an excuse for the attitude,
too. He was just enough to realize that. As
she had said, she was born differently, bred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
differently, educated to a life of ease. And he,
Harry Randall, had known it from the first,
knew it when he married her. Just now, to be
sure, he was financially flat, several months ahead
of his meagre salary; but that did not alter
the original premise, the original obligation. He
remembered this now as he looked at her, remembered
and decided&mdash;the only way it seemed
to him possible an honorable man could decide.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, Margery,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;you
may have the maid back, of course, if you wish
it. I had hoped we might get along for a time,
while we were paying for the things in the
house, anyway; but&#8221;&mdash;he looked away&mdash;&#8220;I
guess we&#8217;ll manage it somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Somehow!&#8221; Margery glanced at him with
only partial comprehension. &#8220;Is it really as
bad as that, as hopeless?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall smiled the slow smile that made his
smooth face seem fairly boyish.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what you mean by
bad, or hopeless; but it&#8217;s a fact that so far
we&#8217;ve been spending a good deal more than
my income.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, dear, really.&#8221; It was the contrition
of one absolutely unaccustomed to consideration
of ways and means, uncomprehending.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
&#8220;Particularly so just now with winter coming
on and&mdash;and girls, you know, have to get such
a lot of things for winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time Randall did not smile; neither did
he show irritation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What, for instance?&#8221; he inquired directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh, a tailored suit for one thing, and a
winter hat, and high shoes, and&mdash;and a lot of
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you really need them, Margery?&#8221; It
was prosaic pathos, but pathos nevertheless.
&#8220;There&#8217;s coal to be bought, you know, and my
life insurance comes due next month. I don&#8217;t
want to seem to be stingy, you know that;
but&mdash;&#8221; he halted miserably.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Need them!&#8221; It was mild vexation. &#8220;Of
course I need them, silly. A girl can&#8217;t go
around when the thermometer&#8217;s below zero with
net shirtwaists and open-work stockings.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; quickly. With an effort the
smile returned. &#8220;Order what you need. I&#8217;ll
take care of that too&#8221;&mdash;he was going to repeat
&#8220;somehow,&#8221; then caught himself&mdash;&#8220;as
soon as I can,&#8221; he substituted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl looked at him smilingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Poor old Harry, henpecked Harry,&#8221; she
bantered gayly. Crossing over, her arms went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
around his neck. &#8220;Have an awful lot of
troubles, don&#8217;t you, professor man!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The argument was irresistible and Randall
capitulated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, none whatever,&#8221; he answered, as he was
expected to answer; and once more sweet peace
rested on the house of Randall.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Back in her place opposite once more Margery
looked at her husband seriously, a pucker
of perplexity on her smooth face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By the way,&#8221; she digressed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
wondering for some time now if anything&#8217;s
wrong with Elice and Steve. Has he hinted
anything to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; why?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know anything definite; but he&#8217;s
been here three evenings the last week, you
know, Sunday evening for one at that, and it
looks queer.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed it too,&#8221; admitted Randall, &#8220;and
he&#8217;s coming again this evening. He asked permission
and I couldn&#8217;t well refuse. Not that
I don&#8217;t like to have him come,&#8221; quickly, &#8220;but
it interferes with my lectures next morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And with our own evenings. I&mdash;just wish
he wouldn&#8217;t come so often.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall said nothing, but unconsciously he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
was stroking the bald spot already appearing
on the crown of his head in a way he had when
worried.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And, besides,&#8221; justified Margery, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
treating Elice right. I think it&#8217;s a shame.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time the man looked up.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t say anything, intimate anything,
I hope?&#8221; he hesitated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Of course not. It isn&#8217;t her way. She&#8217;s&mdash;queer
for a woman, Elice is; she never gets
confidential, no matter how good an opportunity
you offer.&#8221; A pause followed that spoke volumes.
&#8220;Agnes Simpson, though, says there is
something the matter&mdash;with Steve at least.
They&#8217;re talking about it in the department.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Talking about what, Margery?&#8221; soberly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a friend of ours, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; the voice was swift with a
pent-up secret, &#8220;and we&#8217;ve tried hard to be nice
to him; but, after all, we&#8217;re not to blame that
he&mdash;drinks!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Margery!&#8221; It was open disapproval this
time, a thing unusual for Harry Randall. &#8220;We
mustn&#8217;t listen to such gossip, either of us. Steve
and I have been chums for years and years
and&mdash;we simply mustn&#8217;t listen to such things
at all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant the girl was silent; then the
brown head tossed rebelliously.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help it if people talk; and it
isn&#8217;t fair of you to suppose that I pass it on
either&mdash;except to you. You know that I&mdash;&#8221;
she checked herself. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t as though Agnes
was the only one either,&#8221; she defended. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
heard it several times lately.&#8221; Inspiration came
and she looked at her husband directly. &#8220;Honest,
Harry, haven&#8217;t you heard it too?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man hesitated, and on the instant solid
ground vanished from beneath his feet.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; he admitted weakly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a burning shame too that people will concoct&mdash;&#8221;
He halted suddenly, listening. His eyes went
to the clock. &#8220;I had no idea it was so late,&#8221;
he digressed as the bell rang loudly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
Steve now. I know his ring.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Alone in the up-stairs study, which with its
folding-bed was likewise spare sleeping-room
and again smoking-room,&mdash;Margery had not
yet surrendered to the indiscriminate presence
of tobacco smoke,&mdash;Steve Armstrong ignored
the chair Randall had proffered and remained
standing, his hands deep in his trousers&#8217; pockets,
a look new to his friend&mdash;one restless, akin to
reckless&mdash;on his usually good-humored face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
Contrary again to precedent his dress was noticeably
untidy, an impression accentuated by a
two-days&#8217; growth of beard and by neglected
linen. That something far from normal was
about to transpire Randall knew at a glance,
but courteously seemed not to notice. Instead,
with a familiar wave, he indicated the cigar-jar
he kept on purpose for visitors and took a pipe
himself.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had my after-dinner smoke yet,&#8221;
he commented. &#8220;Better light up with me. It
always tastes better when one has company.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Armstrong made a selection absently
and struck a match; but, the unlighted
cigar in his fingers, let the match burn dead.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to bother you long,&#8221; he
plunged without preface. &#8220;I know you want
to work.&#8221; He glanced nervously at the door
to see that it was closed. &#8220;I just wanted to
have a little talk with you, a&mdash;little heart-to-heart
talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Randall&#8217;s face showed no surprise,
but his pipe bowl was aglow and his free hand
was caressing his bald spot steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Frankly, old man,&#8221; the other had fallen back
into his former position, his hands concealed, his
attitude stiffly erect, &#8220;I&#8217;m in the deuce of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
frame of mind to-night&mdash;and undecided.&#8221; He
laughed shortly. &#8220;You&#8217;re the remedy that occurred
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Randall repeated, this time with the
slow smile, &#8220;I am a sort of remedy. Sit down
and tell me about it. I&#8217;m receptive at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sit down! I can&#8217;t, Harry.&#8221; The restless
look became one of positive repugnance. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t been able to for a half-hour at a stretch
for a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Try it anyway,&#8221; bluntly. &#8220;It won&#8217;t do you
any harm to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nor any good either. I know.&#8221; He threw
himself into a seat with a nervous scowl upon
his face. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able to do any real
work for an age, which is worse,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;My lectures lately have been a disgrace to the
college. No one knows it better than myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment Randall hesitated, but even yet he
did not put an inquiry direct.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes?&#8221; he suggested again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m stale, I guess, or have lost my nerve
or&mdash;or something.&#8221; Armstrong smiled,&mdash;a
crooked smile that failed to extinguish the furrows
on his forehead. &#8220;By the way, have you
got a little superfluous nerve lying about that
you could stake me with?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall echoed the laugh, because it seemed
the only possible answer, but that was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the silence that followed Armstrong looked
at his friend opposite, the nervous furrow between
his eyes deepening.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re wondering,&#8221; he began at
last, &#8220;just what&#8217;s the matter with me and what
I want of you. Concerning the first, there&#8217;s
a lot I might say, but I won&#8217;t; I&#8217;ll spare you.
As to what I want to ask of you&mdash;Frankly,
Harry, straight to the point and conventional
reticence aside, ought I to marry or oughtn&#8217;t
I?&#8221; He caught the other&#8217;s expression and answered
it quickly. &#8220;I know this is a peculiar
thing to ask and seems, looking at it from some
angles, something I shouldn&#8217;t ask; but you
know all the circumstances between Elice and
me and, in a way, our positions are a good deal
similar. Just what do you think? Don&#8217;t hesitate
to tell me exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In his seat Randall shifted uncomfortably; to
gain time he filled his pipe afresh,&mdash;a distinct
dissipation for the man of routine that he was.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Frankly, as you suggest, Steve,&#8221; he answered
finally, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not discuss the subject,
rather not advise. It&#8217;s&mdash;you know why&mdash;so
big and personal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I realize that and have apologized already
for bringing it up; but I can&#8217;t decide myself&mdash;I&#8217;ve
tried; and Elice&mdash;there are reasons why
she can&#8217;t assist now either. It&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221; he made
a motion to rise, but checked himself&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s
something that has to be decided now too.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Has to?&#8221; Randall&#8217;s eyes behind the big
lens of his glasses were suddenly keen. &#8220;Why,
Steve?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Because it&#8217;s now or never,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve&mdash;we&#8217;ve
hesitated until we can&#8217;t delay any
longer. I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s not been too
long already, that&#8217;s why Elice can&#8217;t figure.&#8221; He
drew himself up with an effort, held himself
still. &#8220;We&#8217;ve crossed the dividing line, Elice
and I, and we&#8217;re drifting apart. Just how the
thing has come about I don&#8217;t know; but it&#8217;s true.
We&#8217;re on different roads somehow and we&#8217;re
getting farther apart every month.&#8221; He sprang
to his feet, his face turned away. &#8220;Soon&mdash;It&#8217;s
simply hell, Harry!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall sat still; recollecting, he laughed,&mdash;a
laugh that he tried to make natural.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; He laughed again. &#8220;You&#8217;re
mixing up some of the novels you&#8217;re writing
with real life. This sort of thing is nonsense,
pure nonsense.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, it&#8217;s so,&#8221; flatly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried hard enough
to think it different, but I couldn&#8217;t because it
is so. It&#8217;s hell, I say!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you love her, man?&#8221; abruptly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Love her!&#8221; Armstrong wheeled, his face
almost fierce. &#8220;Of course I love her. A hundred
times yes. I&#8217;m a cursed fool over her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sit down then and tell me just what&#8217;s on
your mind. You&#8217;re magnifying a mole-hill of
some kind into a snow-capped peak. Sit down,
please. You&mdash;irritate me that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A second Armstrong hesitated. His face a
bit flushed, he obeyed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s better.&#8221; The brusqueness was deliberately
intentional. &#8220;Now out with it, clear
the atmosphere. I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong looked at his friend a bit suspiciously;
but the mood was too strong upon him
to cease now even if he would.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just what do you wish to know?&#8221; he asked
in tentative prelude. &#8220;Give me a clew.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What you wish to tell me,&#8221; evenly. &#8220;Neither
more nor less.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You have no curiosity?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall made no comment this time, merely
waited.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, then, if you have no curiosity....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
I don&#8217;t know how much to tell you anyway,
what you don&#8217;t already know. As I said when
I first came in, I didn&#8217;t have it in mind to bore
you at all, I just wanted to ask your opinion&mdash;&#8221;
The speaker halted and hurriedly lit the cigar
he had been holding. &#8220;To jump into the thick
of it, I got a little letter from the president
to-day, a little&mdash;warning.&#8221; Armstrong smoked
fiercely until the flame lit up his face. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the bitterest humiliation of my life, Harry, the
last straw!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>REBELLION</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment Harry Randall said nothing,
then deliberately he glanced up and met
his friend&#8217;s eyes direct.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Begin at the beginning and tell me the whole
story,&#8221; he said soberly. &#8220;I had no idea the
thing was really so serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, it is, take that for granted. It&#8217;s
likely to be the end, so far as I am concerned.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Cut that out, Steve,&#8221; shortly. &#8220;It&#8217;s melodramatic
and cheap. Things can&#8217;t be so bad
if we look at them sanely.&#8221; He hesitated, and
went on with distinct effort. &#8220;To begin with,
I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. I hate it,
you know that without my telling you, but
things have gone too far to mince matters evidently.
I&#8217;ve heard a number of times lately
that you were drinking. Is it so?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; hotly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Never mind who. I tell you I never believed
a word of it until you mentioned the
president&#8217;s warning. Now&mdash;Is it so?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong&#8217;s face went red,&mdash;red to the roots
of his hair,&mdash;then slowly shaded white until it
was ghastly pale.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s useless, it seems, to deny it. That
others knew, were talking about it, though&mdash;It&#8217;s
true, Harry. I admit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Slowly, slowly, Randall knocked the ashes
out of the pipe-bowl and put it away in a
drawer of the table.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, Steve. I shan&#8217;t moralize. None
of us men are so good we can afford to begin
throwing stones.... Let&#8217;s go back a bit to
the beginning. There must be one somewhere,
a cause. Just what&#8217;s the trouble, old
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Trouble!&#8221; It was the spark to tinder, the
lead at last. &#8220;Everything, Harry, everything.&#8221;
A halt for composure. &#8220;I suppose if I were
to pick out one single thing, though, that was
worse than another, it&#8217;s my writing. I think,
I know, that&#8217;s what brought on the whole
cursed mess. Until my last book failed I had
hope and the sun shone. When that went down&mdash;down
like a lump of lead&mdash;I haven&#8217;t been
able to do a thing, care for a thing since. My
brain simply quit work too. It died, and the
best of me died with it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you began to drink.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, like a fish. Why not, since I was dead
and it helped me to forget?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve! I hate to preach, it doesn&#8217;t become
me; but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Preach if you want to; you can&#8217;t hurt my
feelings now.&#8221; Armstrong grew calm, for the
first time that evening. &#8220;When a fellow has
worked as I have worked for years, and hoped
against hope, and still hoped on and worked on
after failure and failure and failure three times
repeated&mdash;No, don&#8217;t worry about hurting my
feelings, Harry. Say what you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to hurt your feelings,&#8221;
evenly; &#8220;I was only going to preach a little.
I merely wanted to take exception to that forgetting
business. If you&#8217;ll just hold hard for
a bit you&#8217;ll forget normally, not artificially.
Another six months and you&#8217;ll be hard at another
scheme, developing it; and the way you
feel now&mdash;It&#8217;ll be a joke then, a sort of
nightmare to laugh over.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Never.... Don&#8217;t get restless; I&#8217;m not irresponsible
now. I&#8217;m merely telling you. I&#8217;ve
been asleep and dreaming for a long time, but
at last I&#8217;m awake. Come what may, and truly
as I&#8217;m telling you now, I&#8217;ll never write another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
novel. I couldn&#8217;t if I wanted to&mdash;I&#8217;ve tried
and know; and I wouldn&#8217;t if I could. There&#8217;s
a limit to everything, and the limit of my patience
and endurance is reached. I&#8217;m done for
now and for all time.&#8221; The voice was not excited
now or unnaturally tense, but normal, almost
conversational.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For ten years I&#8217;ve fought the good fight.
Every spare hour of that time that I could
muster I&#8217;ve worked. I&#8217;ve lain awake night
after night and night after night tossing and
planning and struggling for a definite end.
The thing got to be a sort of religion to me. I
convinced myself that it was my work in the
big scheme, my allotted task, and I tried faithfully
to do it. I never spared myself. I dissected
others, of course; but I dissected myself
most, clear to the bone. I even took a sort of
joy in it when it hurt most, for I felt it was
my contribution and big. I&#8217;m not bragging
now, mind. I&#8217;m merely telling you as it was.
I&#8217;ve gone on doing this for ten years, I say.
When I failed again I tried harder still. I still
believed in myself&mdash;and others. Recognition,
appreciation, might be delayed, but eventually
it would come, it must; for this was my work,&mdash;to
please others, to amuse them, to carry them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
temporarily out of the rut of their work-a-day
lives and make them forget. I believed this, I
say, believed and hoped and waited and worked
on until the last few months. Then&mdash;I told
you what happened. Then&mdash;&#8221; For the first
time the speaker paused. He shrugged characteristically.
&#8220;But what&#8217;s the use of disturbing
the corpse. I&#8217;ve simply misread the signs in
the sky&mdash;that&#8217;s all. I couldn&#8217;t produce a better
novel than I&#8217;ve written if I had the longevity
of the Wandering Jew and wrote to the end&mdash;for
I&#8217;ve done my best. The great public that
I&#8217;ve torn myself to pieces to please has seen
the offering and passed it by. They will have
none of it&mdash;and they&#8217;re the arbiters.&#8221; He
shrugged again, the narrow shoulders eloquent.
&#8220;So be it. I accept; but I offer no more. For
all time, to finality, I&#8217;m done, done!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Even if some of your books should win?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If every one of them should do so. If half
a dozen publishers came to me personally and
begged me to resume work. I may be a poor
artist, may lack completely the artistic subservience
to or superiority to discouragement, probably
I do; but at least I know I&#8217;m human.
I&#8217;m like a well in the desert that&#8217;s been pumped
empty and left never a mark on the surrounding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
sand. I couldn&#8217;t produce again if I wanted
to; I&#8217;m drained dry.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall said nothing. He knew this other
man.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I tell you I&#8217;m awake, Harry, at last, and
see things as they are; things now so childishly
obvious that it seems incredible I could have
gone on so long without recognizing them.
People prate about appreciation of artists of
various kinds and of their work, grow maudlin
over it by artificial light in the small hours of
the night. And how do they demonstrate it?
Once in a while, the isolated exception that
proves the rule, by recognizing and rewarding
the genius in his lifetime. Once in a very, very
long time, I say. Mind, I don&#8217;t elevate myself
as a genius. I&#8217;m merely speaking as an observer
who&#8217;s awakened and knows. As a rule
what do they do? Let him struggle and work
and eat his heart out in obscurity and without
recognition. Let him starve himself body and
soul. After he&#8217;s dead, after a year or a hundred
years, after there is no possibility of his
receiving the reward or the inspiration, they
arouse. His fame spreads. His name becomes
a household word. They desecrate his grave, if
they can find it, by hanging laurel on his tombstone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
They tear the wall-paper from the house
where he once chanced to live into ribbons for
souvenirs. If he happens to be a painter the
picture that brought him enough perhaps to keep
body and soul together for a month is fought
for until eventually it sells for a fortune. If
he was a writer they bid for a scrap of his
manuscript more than he received for his whole
work. There are exceptions, I say; but even
exceptions only prove the rule. Think over the
names of the big artists, the big geniuses. How
many of them are alive or were appreciated in
their own lives? How many living to-day compare
in the public appreciation with those dead?
None of them, practically, none. And still do
you or does any other sane person fancy that
human beings are degenerating every generation,
that artistic genius is decadent? It&#8217;s preposterous,
unthinkable! It merely points the
moral that history repeats itself. Some place,
somewhere, the greatest artist in the world is
painting the greatest picture the world has ever
known&mdash;and this same world passes him by. It
must be so, for human beings advance with every
generation inevitably. Some place, somewhere,
the biggest writer of all time is writing the biggest
book&mdash;and his neighbors smile because his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
clothes are rusty. This is the reward they get
in their own day and their own generation, when
it would sweeten their lives, make them worth
living. The fellow who invents a mouse-trap
or a safety razor or devises a way of sticking
two hogs where one was killed before, inherits
the earth, sees his name and fame heralded in
every periodical; while the other, the real man&mdash;God,
it&#8217;s unbelievable, neither more nor less;
and still it&#8217;s true to the last detail. Again, it&#8217;s
all civilization, the civilization we brag of; magnificent
twentieth century civilization!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still Randall said nothing, still waited.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong hesitated, drumming on the arm
of his chair with his slender fingers. But the
lull was only temporary, the storm not past;
the end was not yet.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he forged on, &#8220;the work should
be its own reward, its own justification. At
least would-be artists are told so repeatedly.
Whenever one rebels at the injustice the world
is there with this sophistry, feeds him with it as
a nurse feeds pap to a crying child, until he&#8217;s
full and temporarily comatose. But just suppose
for an instant that the same argument were
used in any other field of endeavor. Suppose,
for instance, you told the prospector who&#8217;d spent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
years searching for and who&#8217;d finally found a
gold mine that his reward should be in the mere
knowledge of having found it, the feeling of
elation that he had added to the sum total of
the world&#8217;s wealth, and that he should relinquish
it intact as a public trust. Just preach this
gospel, and how long would you escape the
mad-house? Or the architect who designs and
superintends the construction of a sky-scraper.
Take him aside and argue with him that the
artistic satisfaction of having conceived that
great pile of stone and steel should repay him
for his work, that to expect remuneration was
sordid and disgusting. Do you think he&#8217;d sign
a certificate to the effect that you were normal
and sane? And still how is it with a writer in
this the twentieth century,&mdash;century of enlightenment
and of progress? First of all he must
go through the formative period, which means
years. Nothing, even genius, springs without
preparation into full bloom. No matter how
good the idea, how big the thought, it must be
moulded by a mastery of technique and a proficiency
that only experience can give. And
meanwhile he must live. How? No matter.
The suggestion is mundane. Let him settle
that for himself. At last, perhaps, if he has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the divine spark, he gets a hearing. We&#8217;ll
suppose he accomplishes his purpose,&mdash;pleases
them, makes them think, or laugh, or forget
temporarily, as the case may be. In a way he
has made an opening and arrived. And yet,
though an artist, he is, first of all, a human being,
an animal. The animal part of him demands
insistently the good things of life. If he is
normal he wants a home and a family of his
own; and wants that home as good as that of
his neighbor who practises law or makes soda
biscuits. With this premise what do the public,
who don&#8217;t know him personally but whom he
serves just the same, do? The only way they
can show their appreciation tangibly is by buying
his work; giving him encouragement, making
it possible to live and to write more. I
repeat I know this is all mundane and commonplace
and unæsthetic, but it&#8217;s reality. And do
they give this encouragement, buy themselves,
and let him make his tiny royalty which in turn
enables him to live, pass an appreciation on to
their friends and induce them to buy? In a
fractional proportion of times, yes. In the main,
John, whom the writer has worked a year, day
and night, to reach, by chance meets his friend
Charley. &#8216;By the way,&#8217; he remarks, &#8216;I picked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
up that novel of Blank&#8217;s lately. It&#8217;s good, all
right, all right; kept me up half the night to
finish it. I want you to read it, old man. It&#8217;s
just your style. No use to buy it, though,&#8217; he
adds hurriedly. &#8216;Drop in sometime and I&#8217;ll
lend it to you.&#8217; Of a sudden he remembers.
&#8216;Come to think of it, though, I believe just
now it&#8217;s lent to Phil&mdash;or was it Dick who took
it. The story&#8217;s a corker and they&#8217;ve both had
it.&#8217; He thinks again hard and remembers. &#8216;I
have it now. Dick gave it to Sam; he told me
so. Get it from him yourself. I know you&#8217;ll
like it.&#8217; And so the lending goes on so long
as the covers hold together. Meanwhile the
writer, away off somewhere waiting and hoping
and watching the sale, in return for the pleasure
he gives John and Charley and Phil and Dick
and Sam and the rest, and in consideration of
that year of work and weariness and struggle,
gets enough perhaps to buy a meal at a Chinese
restaurant. This is appreciation, I say, enlightened
twentieth century appreciation; and the
beauty of it is that every one of that company
who get his work for nothing feel that by their
praise and by reading his work they&#8217;ve given
that writer, who can&#8217;t possibly know anything
about it, all that he could possibly desire.&#8221; For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
the first time that evening Armstrong paused
to laugh. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s humorous, all right, when
one stops to consider and appreciate! Just suppose,
though, in the name of fair play, some
one had suggested to John that he throw that
copy of his in the furnace where no one could
possibly borrow it, and then go on telling his
appreciation. Just supposing some one had
suggested that! Do you fancy John would
have considered that person wholly sane? And
still that writer, besides being an artist, is an
animal with a stomach and needs a home to live
in, and maybe is human enough to have burdened
himself with a wife and&mdash;and children&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve, confound it, you&#8217;ve gone on long
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know it&mdash;too long.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do any good to rail at something
you can&#8217;t help, that no one can help.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Admitted. I&#8217;m just talking to myself&mdash;and
you. It&#8217;s all the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve never starved yet or gone without
clothes, so far as I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Starved, no. I had soup at my boarding-house
for lunch again to-day&mdash;soup with carrots
in it. Hungry&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. This is
a big world we&#8217;re in and I&#8217;ve never had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
chance even to look over the horizon yet.
Hungry? I&#8217;ve been hungry for&mdash;Elice for
years, and I don&#8217;t dare&mdash;Hunger is awfully
near to starvation sometimes, friend Harry.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Harry Randall squirmed. He saw it coming&mdash;it!
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh, things will come all right if you&#8217;ll be
patient,&#8221; he said&mdash;and halted himself for the
trite optimism.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice won&#8217;t; for she&#8217;s gone already while
I&#8217;ve been patient&mdash;gone and left me hungry.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nonsense. Rot, plain rot!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, reality, plain reality. She probably
wouldn&#8217;t admit it yet, not even to herself,
maybe doesn&#8217;t know it yet herself; but I know.
It&#8217;s been coming on a long time. I see it all
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall made a wry face. That was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s true, Harry, God&#8217;s truth. I asked
you a peculiar question a while ago,&mdash;asked
whether I ought to marry. I didn&#8217;t mean it;
I was just maudlin. I know without asking
that I mustn&#8217;t. Even if Elice would consent&mdash;and
I think she would consent yet, she&#8217;s
game&mdash;I mustn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m waking up more all
the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve, you&#8217;re maddening&mdash;impossible. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
tell you, Elice will never change. You know it
without my telling you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know. It&#8217;s I who have changed.&#8221;
He remembered suddenly. &#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s I who
have changed,&#8221; he repeated slowly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll change back again then.&#8221; The
effort to be severe and commonplace was becoming
cumulatively difficult. &#8220;You must.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Must change back&mdash;and marry Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; desperately.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not if by a miracle I could change
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why? For heaven&#8217;s sake, why? Don&#8217;t be
a fool, man.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why?&#8221; without heat. &#8220;Do you really wish
to know why?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong deliberated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You yourself are one reason, friend Harry.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, you do. I&#8217;m not without observation.
You yourself wouldn&#8217;t advise me to marry
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t, and you know you wouldn&#8217;t.
No offence. We&#8217;re simply looking things
squarely in the eye. It&#8217;s merely the tragedy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
of pennies among evolved humans who require
dollars to live&mdash;and must live. Am I not
right, friend of mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No severity this time, no commonplace&mdash;nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, no offence; just square in the eye.
Am I not right?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Right? I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t answer.&#8221;
A sudden blaze. &#8220;You have no right to
suggest&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. Pardon me.&#8221; Armstrong&#8217;s face worked
in spite of himself. &#8220;Forget that I did suggest,
Harry. It was brutal of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But with Elice and myself it&#8217;s different.
I&#8217;ve awakened in time. Providence, perhaps,
sometimes when we least expect it&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; Randall had glanced up quickly,
self for the moment in abeyance. &#8220;What do
you intend doing, tell me that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Doing?&#8221; It was almost surprise. &#8220;Have
you any honest doubt yet, after what I&#8217;ve told
you?&#8221; He halted, scrutinizing his friend&#8217;s face,
and seemed satisfied. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to release
her; release her unqualifiedly. I can at least
be man enough to do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And if you do&mdash;what of yourself?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong smiled forcedly, a slow, mirthless
smile. &#8220;Never mind about myself. I&#8217;ve glowed
genially for a long time, tried after my own
fashion to warm a hearth somewhere; but at
last I&#8217;m burned out, nothing but cinders. Never
mind about myself. The discussion is futile.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall hesitated; then he gestured impotently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice, then&mdash;For her sake at least&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s for her sake I&#8217;ll do it, because she&#8217;ll
never do it herself. I repeat, I can at least be
man enough to do that much for her, make
amends to that extent.&#8221; He looked straight
before him, seeing nothing. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be happy
yet, when I&#8217;m well out of the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; Argument would not come, rebuttal;
only that cry that acknowledged its own
helplessness. &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to have things go
that way. I know you both so well, like you
so much.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I realize that,&#8221; dully; &#8220;but it&#8217;s not your
fault,&mdash;not any one&#8217;s fault in particular that
I can see.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall did not gesture this time. Even that
avenue seemed barred.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If I could only say something to influence
you, to convince you&mdash;something adequate.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to be said that I can see,
or done, for that matter. It&#8217;s like a church
catechism, cut and dried generations ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the final word, and for a long time
they sat there silent, unconscious of the passing
minutes; alike gazing at the blank wall which
circumstance had thrown in the way, alike looking
for an opening where opening there was
none. At last, when the silence had become unbearable,
Randall roused, and with an effort
forced a commonplace.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Anyway, as yet you&#8217;re reckoning without
your host&mdash;in this case Elice,&#8221; he formalized.
&#8220;After you&#8217;ve seen her&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It will merely be ended then&mdash;that is all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure, even yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat that I know, know to finality.
Some things one can&#8217;t question when they&#8217;re
awake. Moreover, I have a reason for knowing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was a new note, that last comment; a note
of repression where all before had been unrepressed.
Moreover, it was a lead intentionally
offered.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What is it, Steve?&#8221; asked the other simply.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something yet which you haven&#8217;t told
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Once more Armstrong&#8217;s eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
on the wall straight before him, the wall he did
not see. &#8220;I merely suggested it a bit ago. I
said Elice had drifted away while I was being
patient. At first that drifting was very slow,
so slow that I didn&#8217;t realize it myself; during
the last few months she&#8217;s been going fast.&#8221; The
speaker moistened his lips unconsciously; but,
watching, the other noticed. &#8220;Things seldom
happen in this world without a reason, and they
didn&#8217;t in this case.&#8221; Suddenly, without warning,
he whirled, met the other eye to eye. &#8220;Do
I need to suggest more?&#8221; he asked steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Suggest&mdash;more?&#8221; Randall&#8217;s look was
blank. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I mean concerning&mdash;the reason I mentioned.
Haven&#8217;t you noticed anything yourself, had any
intimation?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know nothing, have noticed nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No?&#8221; Armstrong&#8217;s scrutiny was merciless,
all but incredulous. &#8220;Nothing concerning Elice
and&mdash;and Darley Roberts&mdash;not a whisper?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Against his will Randall&#8217;s eyes dropped. At
last he understood.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You have heard. I thought so.&#8221; Armstrong
fumbled with his cuffs, played for time,
which meant for self-control. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad. It
saves my&mdash;explaining.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221; Randall&#8217;s tongue lagged
unwillingly. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it; but believed,
in the least, before&mdash;no. I thought he was
your friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Was, yes. Now&mdash;It&#8217;s been some time
since we came to an understanding; and he told
me, warned me. I don&#8217;t blame him&mdash;or her.
I&#8217;ve had my chance, ample chance, God knows.... It&#8217;s
simply true.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall looked up unbelievingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you don&#8217;t hate him, you who were his
friend?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Hate?... I don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t know anything
these days except that I&#8217;m down&mdash;down;
down in the mire, deep!&#8221; It was the end, the
last crumb of confidence, and Armstrong leaped
to his feet. &#8220;But what&#8217;s the use of dissecting
any more, what possible use?&#8221; His hat was in
his hand and he was heading for the door.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all simply maddening, and I&#8217;m a fool,
a visionary fool, who can&#8217;t change myself or
alter events; powerless&mdash;&#8221; He halted, turned
half about. Instinctive courtesy sprang to his
lips. &#8220;Pardon me, Harry, for bothering you
with all this when you can do nothing. I had
no idea when I came of staying so long or&mdash;or
of making a spectacle of myself.&#8221; He smiled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
almost his old smile. &#8220;Forgive me this time
and I promise never to do it again, never.&#8221;
He turned once more to the door. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get
up, old man. I can find my way out. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve! Wait!&#8221; Randall too was on his feet,
a sudden premonition of things to come in his
mind, a feeling, more than of pity, for the intention
he read clear in the other&#8217;s face. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
go yet&mdash;don&#8217;t go at all. Stay with me to-night,
please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Stay!&#8221; Armstrong too understood, and, understanding,
smiled; a smile the other man never
forgot. &#8220;Stay&mdash;to-night?... No, thank you.
I appreciate your motive,&#8221; hurriedly, &#8220;don&#8217;t
fancy it&#8217;s not that; but&mdash;&#8221; no questioning that
preventing gesture, no combating it&mdash;&#8220;but to-night
I&#8217;m going to forget.... Yes, and to-morrow
night, and the next&mdash;and the next!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>CATASTROPHE</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Three evenings in succession a tall young
man with an ulster turned up high above
his chin and a derby hat lowered well over his
eyes circled the block of which the Gleason lot
and cottage was a part. The first time, in front
of the house itself, he had merely halted, hands
deep in his pockets, obviously uncertain; then,
as though under strain of an immediate engagement
beyond, had hastened on. The second time
he had passed up the walk, half way to the
door; had of a sudden changed his mind, and
disappeared rapidly as before. The third evening,
the present, however, there had been no
uncertainty, no hesitation. Instead, he had
walked straight to the knocker, and, a gray-haired
man in lounging-jacket and carpet slippers
answering his ring, had come to anchor in
the familiar den. From his moorings in the
single comfortable chair the place afforded, which
had been compellingly pressed upon him, he was
listening to the other&#8217;s explanation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think she&#8217;ll return soon, though, very
soon.&#8221; Mr. Gleason adjusted his horn-rimmed
eyeglasses and peered near-sightedly at his big
open-faced silver watch. &#8220;She said she&#8217;d be
back early and it&#8217;s nearly nine now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Something going on, something important,
I mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t think so. Just out for a little
air, and dropped in on one of the girls maybe.
She&#8217;s got three freshmen she&#8217;s coaching now,
and with that out-of-town class and the house
here&mdash;&#8221; The long bony fingers tapped absently
tip to tip. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only time that
she has and I encourage, insist almost, that
she go.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The tapping fingers went still.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think sometimes I&#8217;m a bit guilty that she
at her age&mdash;that it should seem to be necessary,
I mean&mdash;Maybe I imagine it, but it
seems to me as though Elice was sort of fagged
and different this winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The visitor unbuttoned his coat leisurely.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t noticed it,&#8221; he refuted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No? I&#8217;m glad to hear you say it. You&#8217;d
have noticed, I guess, if any one. Probably it&#8217;s
all my imagination.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice herself hasn&#8217;t said anything, intimated
anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not a word or a hint. Certainly not.&#8221;
Something akin to surprise spoke in the quick
reply. &#8220;She even wanted to take on another
out-of-town class, but I vetoed that. She&#8217;s as
her mother was, Elice: always planning on doing
just a little more.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Than she ought, you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Without apparent excuse, unconsciously, the
visitor rebuttoned his double-breasted coat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Some people,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;work&mdash;more
than they ought to, to forget; and others again
do&mdash;various things.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What? I beg your pardon.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To forget, to attain callousness, to cease to
feel. There are many formulas tried, many.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I fear I fail to understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Doubtless. I don&#8217;t understand myself. I
was simply rambling. Pardon me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Over the horn nose-glasses Mr. Gleason scrutinized
the face of the younger man intently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly. For what, though, I admit I&#8217;m
mystified.&#8221; He glanced away perfunctorily.
&#8220;Everything is running normally, I suppose,
in your department?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, about as usual, I guess, practically so.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Better than usual according to Dean Sanford,&#8221;
cheerfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s inclined to brag a
little this year, justifiedly, too, one must admit
from the attendance.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, the attendance is excellent&mdash;among
the students. Among the faculty&mdash;did the dean
seem inclined to brag any on the faculty?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; he only talked a few moments.&#8221; Mr.
Gleason produced the big timepiece again hastily.
&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock. I wonder what can be
keeping Elice,&#8221; he fidgeted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The visitor smiled, an odd smile, neither of
bitterness nor yet of amusement.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not inclined particularly to brag on his faculty,
the dean, I gather?&#8221; returned Armstrong.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The older man straightened. Out of kindness
he would retreat so far; but if pursued&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, he barely mentioned the faculty, as I
remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not even the professor of chemistry?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The horn-rimmed glasses had left their owner&#8217;s
nose and, as they had a way of doing when the
old man was abstracted, swung like a pendulum
from his fingers.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not even the professor of chemistry?&#8221; repeated
Armstrong.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Very quietly the older man held his ground,
very steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just what is it you wish to know, Steve?&#8221;
he asked directly. &#8220;You gathered, of course, it
was a board meeting I referred to&mdash;and confidential
naturally. I think I need say no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, no more, certainly. I was merely curious
to know if you knew. You&#8217;ve satisfied my
curiosity, I believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Satisfied! I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re taking a bit
for granted. I repeat, if you&#8217;ll tell me explicitly
what you wish&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was mistaken, then, after all,&#8221; with a
peculiar direct look. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really know,
Sanford didn&#8217;t announce&mdash;I&#8217;m surprised. I
never fancied he&#8217;d miss the opportunity. It&#8217;s
superhuman repression!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For fully half a minute Mr. Gleason said
nothing; then at the interrupting sound of footsteps
in the storm vestibule, followed an instant
later by the click of a latch-key, he leaned suddenly
toward the younger man.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s Elice now,&#8221; he said. The voice was
almost childishly hurried and curious. &#8220;What
was it that you wondered I didn&#8217;t know, that
Sanford didn&#8217;t announce?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From under shaded lids Armstrong observed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
the change and smiled. The smile vanished as
a shadow passed through the entrance.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I merely marvelled that the dean didn&#8217;t
announce that there would be no professor of
chemistry after another week, the close of the
present semester,&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;That is,
until a new one is appointed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; The old man&#8217;s face went gray,&mdash;gray
as the face of a believer whose gods
have been offered sacrilege. In the silence the
shadow advanced to the doorway of the room
itself; very real, paused there waiting, all-seeing,
listening. &#8220;You mean you&#8217;re leaving the department
then, quitting for good?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For good, no, hardly.&#8221; Again a laugh, but
tense now, forced. &#8220;Nor quitting. In plain
English I mean I&#8217;m kicked out, fired. By request,
very insistent request, I&#8217;ve resigned.&#8221;
With an effort he met the girl&#8217;s eyes fairly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve babbled my last lecture in college halls,
piped my swan song. The curtain is down, the
orchestra has packed its instruments. Only the
echo now remains.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Tell me about it, Steve.&#8221; The old man had
gone, dodderingly, on a pitifully transparent
pretext. The girl had tossed coat and gloves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
on one chair and herself had taken another, removing
her hat as she spoke.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Begin at the beginning and tell me what&#8217;s
the matter&mdash;what this all means.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There is no beginning that I know of,&#8221; with
a shrug that fell far short of the indifferent.
&#8220;What it means I&#8217;ve already told you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The hat followed the coat, hanging where it
caught on the latter by one pin. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not
dissimulate for the present,&#8221; pleaded the girl, &#8220;or
juggle words. There&#8217;s a time for everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And the present?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please! As a favor, if you wish.
Begin at the beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, there is none to my knowledge.
There&#8217;s only an end.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The end, then,&#8221; swiftly; &#8220;the reason for it.
Don&#8217;t you wish to tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t wish to. I intend to tell you,
however. It was all regular, my retirement; no
one at fault among the powers that are. I had
been warned&mdash;and failed to profit. It was very
regular.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, yes; but the reason! Tell me that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly. I was just coming to it. I failed
to materialize at the department two days in
succession. I overslept.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve Armstrong! Steve&mdash;what do you
fancy I&#8217;m made of! Do you mean to tell me
or merely to&mdash;dissect?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not dissect, to tell you. That&#8217;s why I
came; to tell you several things, this among the
rest. Elice, don&#8217;t do that, don&#8217;t cry. Please!&mdash;I
don&#8217;t intend to be a brute, I didn&#8217;t mean
anything. I&#8217;m simply ashamed to tell you
straight from the shoulder. I&#8217;m down in the
gutter. You&#8217;ll hear, though, anyway. I might
better&mdash;I was drunk, irresponsible, two days
in succession. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&mdash;that way; you, Steve Armstrong!&#8221;
No tears now, no hysterics; just steady, unbelieving
expectancy. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it&mdash;won&#8217;t.
You&#8217;re playing with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, it&#8217;s true. I won&#8217;t say &#8216;God knows it&#8217;s
true.&#8217; I&#8217;m not dog enough yet to&mdash;blaspheme.
It&#8217;s simply true.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; The girl was on her feet, half way to
him. &#8220;I never dreamed, never&mdash;You poor boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice, don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t touch me. I ask it&mdash;don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What&mdash;you can&#8217;t mean&mdash;that!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. Sit down, please.&#8221; The voice was
thick. &#8220;I have several things to tell you. This
was only one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For long, interminably long it seemed to the
watcher, the girl stood where she had paused,
midway; the figure of her still, too still, her
face shading first red to the ear tips, then slowly
colorless as understanding drove home. A half-minute
probably, in reality, immeasurably longer
to them both it seemed, she stood so. Without
a word she went back to her seat, remained
there, unnaturally still, her arms, bare to the
elbow in half sleeves, forming a great white V
as the clasped hands lay motionless in her lap.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For another half-minute no word was spoken,
no sound from without drifted into the room.
Suddenly the girl turned, her great dark eyes
met those of the man, held them steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You said there was something else you
wished to tell me. I can&#8217;t imagine anything
more, anything you didn&#8217;t tell just now. However,
I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man said nothing, nor moved&mdash;just
looked at her.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I notice.&#8221; Armstrong pulled himself
together absently. &#8220;I was thinking of something
else; I&#8217;d forgotten momentarily. I always
was an absent-minded specimen; and lately&mdash;I&#8217;ve
been worse than usual lately.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl merely waited this time, the great
brown eyes wide and dry.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;When it comes to telling you, though,&#8221;
stumbled on the man, &#8220;what I came to tell you
to-night, what I don&#8217;t wish to tell you but
must&mdash;Elice, don&#8217;t look at me, please; don&#8217;t!
My nerve&#8217;s gone. Don&#8217;t you wish to ask me
questions instead?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; obediently the girl turned away,
&#8220;after you&#8217;ve made things clear a bit. Don&#8217;t
fancy I&#8217;m trying to make it hard for you.
I&#8217;m not, only, only&mdash;Remember, I&#8217;m all in
the dark yet, all confused.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know&mdash;and I&#8217;m to blame. I&#8217;ve
been trying for a week to bring myself to tell
you, one thing at a time; but I couldn&#8217;t, and
now&mdash;everything&#8217;s tumbled on my head together
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Everything? Steve, begin somewhere, anywhere.
Don&#8217;t suggest things; tell me. It&#8217;s been
ten days since you called last. Why was that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was afraid. I tried to come, but I
couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Of you, of myself, of life. I&#8217;ve known that
long to a certainty that the play was over between
you and me, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
to say the word. It&#8217;s just this I was afraid
of. This!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean to tell me now that all is over?&#8221;
Unconsciously this time the girl had shifted facing;
quietly&mdash;again, too quietly&mdash;was putting
the query direct: &#8220;That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re telling
me now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why&mdash;Am I the cause&mdash;have I by
word or act&mdash;have I?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Is it because you&#8217;ve lost your chair in the
University?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Because we&#8217;ve ceased to be necessary to
each other, have grown apart.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think we&#8217;ve changed?... I&#8217;ve not
changed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. It&#8217;s I who have changed, have grown
away from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Since when? Let&#8217;s have it all. Let&#8217;s understand
everything. Since when?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when, can&#8217;t set a date. I
merely know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&mdash;that you don&#8217;t care for me any
more?&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 398px;'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; The girl was on her feet. &#8220;I never dreamed, never&mdash;You poor boy!&#8221; (<i>Page 153</i>)<br />
</p>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A halt, a long, long halt.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, Elice,&#8221; said a voice at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
found out that I don&#8217;t care for you any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As before, the girl said nothing, never
stirred.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t try to defend myself, try to explain,&#8221;
stumbled on the man. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t if
I would. The thing has simply come about&mdash;I
wish to ask you to release me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; Of a sudden the girl was on her
feet, the forced composure of a moment ago in
tatters, the tiny hands locked tight. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
believe it, can&#8217;t credit it. I love you, Steve, in
spite of all you&#8217;ve told me; more, because you
need me more now.&#8221; The locked fingers opened.
She came a step forward in mute appeal. &#8220;Tell
me that you don&#8217;t mean it, that you&#8217;re merely
acting, that, that&mdash;&#8221; As suddenly she halted.
Her face hidden in her hands, she dropped back
into the seat. &#8220;Forget, please,&#8221; she halted,
&#8220;that I did that. I didn&#8217;t mean to. I&mdash;I&mdash;forget
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice&mdash;dear!&#8221; Aroused beyond his purpose,
his determination, the man sprang from
his seat, his eyes ablaze, glorious. &#8220;Elice&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not pity! Never, a thousand times no!
Leave me alone a minute. I release you, yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
yes; but don&#8217;t come near me now. I&#8217;m hysterical
and irresponsible. Don&#8217;t, please!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Precisely where he stood Armstrong paused,
looking down. After that first involuntary
sound he had not spoken or come closer. He
merely remained there, waiting, looking; and as
he did so, though the room was far from close,
drops of sweat gathered on his forehead and
beneath his eyes. With a restless hand he
brushed them away and sat down. Another
minute passed, two perhaps; then suddenly,
interrupting, incongruous, there sounded the
strained rasp of his laugh.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice,&#8221; followed a voice, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you through&mdash;nearly?&#8221;
Again the laugh; grating, unmirthful.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done this sort of thing identically
in novels several times, done it realistically,
I thought; but it never took this long by
minutes. Aren&#8217;t you almost through?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Surprised out of herself the girl looked up,
incredulous.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Something must be wrong, art or reality,
one or the other. I&mdash;I wonder&mdash;which was
wrong, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As suddenly as the mood of abandon had come
it passed; incredulity, its successor, as well. In
the space of seconds the miracle was wrought,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
and another woman absolutely sat there looking
forth from the brown eyes of Elice Gleason.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve! I thought I was ready for anything
after what you just told me, what you just
asked. But this deliberate&mdash;insult.... Did
you mean it, Steve, really; or are you merely
acting?... Don&#8217;t look away; this means the
world to you and me, and I want to be sure,
now.... Did you mean it, Steve, the way you
did it, deliberately? Tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mean it? Certainly. It&#8217;s important, what
I asked, from an artist&#8217;s point of view. Either
I was wrong or else reality is&mdash;overdone....
Repression&#8217;s the word, all critics agree, repression
invariably.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve Armstrong! Stop! I won&#8217;t stand it.
Listen. It&#8217;s unbelievable, but I must take you
at your word&mdash;your own word. Do you mean
exactly what you&#8217;ve said, and done?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the moisture sprang to Armstrong&#8217;s
face, but this time there was no attempt at
procrastination.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, Elice,&#8221; he said, and looked her fair.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes? Think. This is final.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant the look held; the brown eyes
dropped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, then, you are released, free.&#8221; She
sat very still. &#8220;Is there anything else you wish
to say?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps. I don&#8217;t know.... You mean, if
I have I&#8217;m to say it now. I can&#8217;t come again....
You&#8217;re not going to forgive me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Forgive? Certainly, if there is anything to
forgive. I had no thought otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not to come again, though. You mean
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I fail to see the object.... To use an expression
of your own, it&#8217;s desecration to disturb
the corpse.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Even if&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Let&#8217;s not argue about nothing. I&#8217;m not
cursed with nerves ordinarily, but there are
times&mdash;&#8221; She arose slowly, stood there beside
her chair, gracefully slender, gracefully imperious.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve chosen deliberately, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221; Armstrong too had arisen
in his dismissal, involuntarily obedient. &#8220;But
you said, before I told you, before you understood,
that afterward, perhaps&mdash;You remember
you said that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I remember. Things are changed
now, though. What I had in mind you&#8217;ve answered
yourself.... One thing I would like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
to ask, however, one thing that I hope you will
answer truly, no matter whether it hurts me or
not. It&#8217;s this: Was I to blame in any way
whatever, by word or act or suggestion, for your
losing your place in the University? Will you
answer me that&mdash;and truly?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From the chair where he had thrown it down
Armstrong took up the long ulster and buttoned
it mechanically to his throat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, Elice,&#8221; he repeated; &#8220;you&#8217;re not at
fault in any way, by word or act or suggestion.
There&#8217;s no one at fault except myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you. I would always have feared,
if I hadn&#8217;t asked, that somehow unintentionally&mdash;&#8221;
She was silent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong hesitated, waiting until there was
no longer hope.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You have nothing else you wish to say,
then?&#8221; he asked at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nothing; unless it is this, that you know
already: I shall always believe in you, Steve,
always.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Believe in me!&#8221; The shade of the old ironic
smile did duty. &#8220;You think I shall still become
wealthy and famous?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;I never demanded
either qualification of you. Why should I lie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
now? Both are right and desirable in their place,
provided they come normally; but their place
is second, not first. You know what I mean.
I believe that you will always be clean and fair
and likeable&mdash;always.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Involuntarily the man turned away, until his
face was hidden.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You believe this, and still&mdash;you don&#8217;t give
advice or&mdash;or warning?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, I believe in you. Even if it weren&#8217;t
an insult advice would not be necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A last second they stood there, so near, so
very near together and still so infinitely far
apart. Dully, almost ploddingly, the man
turned to leave.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you, Elice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably
the last kind word I&#8217;ll hear for a long
time. Perhaps, too, it&#8217;s justified, perhaps&mdash;who
knows? Good-night and&mdash;good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl did not follow him, did not move.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Good-bye, Steve,&#8221; she echoed.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>ANTICIPATION</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Are you given to remembering dates,
Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There had been a pause,&mdash;one of the inevitable,
normal pauses that occur when two people
who are intimate are alone and conversation
drifts where it will. Into this particular void,
without preamble, entered this question.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sometimes. Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not always, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. I haven&#8217;t any particular tendency that
way that I know of. Possibly I&#8217;m not yet old
enough for it to develop.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To be more specific, then, to-day is December
the sixth.&#8221; Darley Roberts&#8217; eyelids narrowed
whimsically. &#8220;Does that particular date
have any special significance, recall anything out
of the ordinary to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason glanced up from the four-leafed
clover she was bringing to life on the scrap of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
linen in her lap, and looked at her companion
thoughtfully.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;From the way you come at me, point blank,&#8221;
she smiled, &#8220;I have no doubt it should. Your
chance questions, I&#8217;ve discovered, always do have
a string attached to them somewhere. But just
at this particular moment I admit December the
sixth recalls nothing in particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not even when I add, at approximately
eight o&#8217;clock in the evening? It&#8217;s that now.
I&#8217;ve been consulting the timepiece over there.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; not even that. I&#8217;m more and more
convinced it&#8217;s a distinct lapse on my part; but
again I&#8217;m compelled to confess incompetency.
When did what happen at approximately eight
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>P.M.</span> on December the sixth?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts stroked his great chin with
reminiscent deliberation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;On December sixth, at eight o&#8217;clock <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>P.M.</span>,
precisely one year ago,&#8221; he explained minutely,
&#8220;a certain man called on a certain young woman
of his acquaintance for the first time. It was,
I am reliably informed, a momentous occasion
for him. Moreover he&mdash;Had you really forgotten,
Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes&mdash;the date.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Strange. I hadn&#8217;t. Perhaps, though, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
meant more to me than to you.&#8221; He laughed
peculiarly. &#8220;I fancy I didn&#8217;t tell you at the
time that it was the first call I&#8217;d ever made on
a young woman in my life.&#8221; He laughed again
with tolerant amusement. &#8220;I was thirty-three
years old then, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl drew a thread of green from a bundle
of silk in her lap deliberately. &#8220;No; you never
told me that,&#8221; she corroborated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The wrinkles gathering about Darley Roberts&#8217;
eyes suddenly deepened, infallible precursor of
the unexpected.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he digressed, &#8220;I&#8217;m growing
curious to know what you do with those things
you&#8217;re embroidering, those&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Lunch cloths?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s it, lunch cloths. The present makes
seven, one after the other, you&#8217;ve completed.
I&#8217;ve kept count.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Curious, you say?&#8221; The girl laughed softly.
&#8220;And still you&#8217;ve never asked.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. I fancied there&#8217;d ultimately be an end,
a variation at least; but it seems I was mistaken.
Do you expect to keep them, as a man
does a case of razors, one for each day of the
week?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the soft little amused laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Hardly. I sell them. There are five more
in prospect&mdash;an even dozen.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Oh. I wondered.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Another void; an equally abrupt return.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To come back to the date,&#8221; recalled the man,
&#8220;I remembered it distinctly this morning when
I tore the top leaf off the desk-pad. It stood
out as though it were printed in red ink, like
the date of a holiday. I&mdash;do I show signs of
becoming senile&mdash;childish, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not that I&#8217;ve noticed. You seem normal.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nor irresponsible&mdash;moonstruck&mdash;nothing
of that kind?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it. I didn&#8217;t know....
Somehow this morning the sight of that date
made me do a thing I haven&#8217;t done since&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know when. I had a consuming desire to
celebrate.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl&#8217;s head was bent low, the better to
see her work.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the man stroked his chin, with the
former movement of whimsical deliberation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you know what people down town, people
I do business with, call me, Elice?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Never heard of &#8216;old man&#8217; Roberts?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s me&mdash;old man Roberts&mdash;old
man&mdash;thirty-four.... By the way, what do
you call me, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mr. Roberts,&#8221; steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not Darley; not once in all this last year?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No answer.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not Darley&mdash;even once?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think not.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The eyes of the man smiled, the eyes only.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To return again, old man Roberts had a
desire to celebrate. The date was on his brain.
He didn&#8217;t even take off his coat after he&#8217;d seen
it&mdash;normally the old man works in his shirt-sleeves,
you know&mdash;he just walked back from
his private room into the general office. &#8216;To-day&#8217;s
a holiday,&#8217; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They stared, the office force&mdash;there are
seven of them. They didn&#8217;t say a word; they
just stared.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I say to-day&#8217;s a holiday,&#8217; the old man <ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: &#8220;re-repeated&#8221; in original text">repeated</ins>, &#8216;shut up shop.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There was a silence. In it Miss Gleason
glanced up&mdash;into two eyes smiling out of a
blank face. Her own dropped. Simultaneously,
also, her ears tinged scarlet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts laughed a low tolerant laugh
at his own expense.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Still think I wasn&#8217;t irresponsible&mdash;moonstruck&mdash;nothing
of the kind?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No&mdash;Mr. Roberts.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wait. After the force had gone, still staring,
the old man went back to his desk. He
looked up a number in the telephone directory.
&#8216;Mr. Herbert? Roberts, Darley Roberts.&mdash;I&#8217;d
like to see you personally. Yes, at once.
I&#8217;m waiting.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the girl glanced up; something made
her. And again she encountered those same
eyes smiling out of a masked face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The old man waited; ten minutes maybe.
He didn&#8217;t do a thing; just waited. Then
events came to pass.&#8221; Once more the little
throaty laugh. &#8220;&#8216;Mr. Herbert,&#8217; he said, &#8216;your
house you advertise for sale. How much this
morning?&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mr. Herbert seemed surprised, distinctly
surprised. He was only half through the door
at the time.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Eighteen thousand dollars. It cost twenty,&#8217;&mdash;after
he&#8217;s caught his breath.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;It cost <i>you</i> fifteen even. I&#8217;ve been to some
trouble to find out.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;You can&#8217;t know the place, Mr.&mdash;Mr.
Roberts.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Yes. Top of the hill. Faces east and north.
Terra cotta, brick. For reasons you know best
it&#8217;s been vacant for a month now.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;You can&#8217;t know the inside, I mean. It&#8217;s
finished in solid hardwood, every inch.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Yes, I&#8217;ve seen it; oak in front, mahogany in
the dining-room, rosewood in the den. I&#8217;ve seen it.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;When? I&#8217;ve lived there nine years until
just lately. Not in that time.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Yes, during that time. I was at a party
there once,&mdash;a university party which Mrs.
Herbert gave.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;All right. Maybe you know.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Unquestionably. I repeat the place cost
you fifteen thousand.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;The price now is eighteen.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;You don&#8217;t wish to sell&mdash;at fifteen?&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;No.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s all, then.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Roberts&mdash;confound it&mdash;&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry to have bothered you. I thought
you wished to sell.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve got to, but I don&#8217;t have to give it
away.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I repeat I&#8217;m sorry to have bothered you.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll see you again; to-morrow perhaps&mdash;&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I shall be very busy to-morrow. To-day&#8217;s
a holiday.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;A holiday! Anyway I haven&#8217;t the abstract.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Unnecessary. I said I knew all about the
place. I see the deed there in your pocket.
You anticipated, I see.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Well, of all the inexplicable hurry!&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Shall I write you a check for&mdash;fifteen
thousand?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts halted. For the third time
he laughed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You gather, perhaps,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I
bought a house this morning. Afterward I
bought a few other things&mdash;just a few. After
that I moved in; into two rooms. I&#8217;ve had
rather a busy day, all told, celebrating&mdash;celebrating
December the sixth.... How about
it, Elice, now that I&#8217;ve elaborated. Any signs
of senility, irresponsibility, yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; very steadily. &#8220;It seems perfectly
natural to me for a man to want a house.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right. Yes; I do want a
house, no doubt about it; particularly that
house. I&#8217;ve been intending to own it sometime
for quite a spell&mdash;for some eight years now;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
to be exact, since the time I saw it before....
You know the place, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, very well.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I fancied so.... By the way, do you recall
that&mdash;occasion I referred to?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Indistinctly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I fancied that too.... You don&#8217;t remember
by any chance what a lion I was that
night?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, Mr. Roberts.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not &#8216;no, Darley&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not even yet; and it&#8217;s been a year!...
As I was about to say, though, I recall distinctly.
I remember I had a perfectly delightful
time&mdash;listening to the others&#8217; conversation.
Likewise dancing&mdash;with myself in a shadowy
corner. Also eating lunch&mdash;with myself later.
I had ample time to think&mdash;and I decided eventually
that there&#8217;d been a slight mistake somehow
when my name got on the list.... I liked
the house, though, very much; so much that I
decided to buy it sometime&mdash;at a nominal figure.
I didn&#8217;t feel peculiarly generous that night
when I made the decision.... Last of all, I
recall I met a girl; rather young then, but
rather pleasant also, I thought. She talked to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
me for an entire minute. I know because I held
my breath the while, and that&#8217;s my limit. She
was the only one who apparently did see me
that night, though. Perhaps her being rather
young was why.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The voice ceased. The speaker looked at the
listener. Simultaneously the listener looked at
the speaker. They smiled, companionably, understandingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s all, I believe, I have to impart concerning
December the sixth, all concerning the
celebration. That is&mdash;&#8221; of a sudden the bantering
voice was serious and low&mdash;&#8220;that is, unless
there&#8217;s something more you&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl was busy with the clover again, very
busy.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve told me all there is to tell,&#8221;
she said steadily. &#8220;I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts waited; but that was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well.&#8221; The voice was normal again,
tolerant, non-committal. &#8220;It&#8217;s your turn, then.
I fear I&#8217;m becoming positively loquacious. I
monopolize the conversation. Let&#8217;s hear your
report since&mdash;Thanksgiving, I believe,&mdash;the
last time I heard it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For some reason the girl lost interest in her
work. At least there seemed less need of immediate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
haste. She rolled the silks and the linen
together with a little unconscious sigh of relief.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Since Thanksgiving,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve cooked
eighteen meals for father and myself. I&#8217;ve been
out of town once, coached two thick heads twice
each, attended one bridge party&mdash;or was it five
hundred? I believe that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not had a call from Miss Simpson?&#8221; smilingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I asked you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; Agnes called&mdash;of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What report of your friends the Randalls,
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Shame on you&mdash;really.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t mean it that way&mdash;really.
You know it. I&#8217;m interested because you are.
How are things coming on with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl fingered the roll in her lap absently.
&#8220;Badly, I&#8217;m afraid. Margery&#8217;s gone to Chicago
to visit her cousin, and shop. She can&#8217;t
seem to realize&mdash;or won&#8217;t. I went over and
baked some things for Harry yesterday. He&#8217;s
dismissed the maid they had and the place looks
as cheerful as a barn. I didn&#8217;t even see him.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You noticed the house, though, doubtless.
Much new furniture about?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, for the dining-room; a complete new
suite, sideboard and all, in weathered oak. It&#8217;s
dear.... How in the world did you know,
though?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A big rug, too, and curtains, and&mdash;a lot
of things?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How did you know, you? Tell me that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Would you say it was worth four hundred
dollars in all, what you saw?&#8221; The eyes were
smiling again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps. I don&#8217;t know. I have never
bought such things.... You haven&#8217;t answered
my question yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know because Mr. Randall told me. He
also requested me, as a favor, to ask you about
them instead of going to the house myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Which means you made him a loan to pay
the bill. Are you a friend of Harry&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A loan, yes. A friend&mdash;only as your friends
are mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad, a burning shame&mdash;when
Harry works so hard, too.&#8221; The girl winked
fast, against her will. &#8220;I can&#8217;t quite forgive
Margery.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For going to Chicago?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For everything. For that too.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not if I told you I advised her to go?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You!&#8221; In astonishment complete the girl
stared. &#8220;You advised her to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, the same day I made Randall the loan.
It was really a coincidence. I wondered they
didn&#8217;t meet in the elevator.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A lawyer in a little town like this, with
several departments in his business, comes in
contact with a variety of things,&#8221; he commented
after a moment.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Tell me about Margery.&#8221; The girl seemed
to have heard that suggestion only. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
understand, can&#8217;t believe&mdash;really.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment Roberts was silent. There
was no banter in his manner when he looked
up at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you this merely to gossip,&#8221; he
said slowly; &#8220;I think you appreciate that without
my saying it; but somehow I felt that you
ought to know&mdash;that if any one could do any
good there it is you. I never met either of
them before, that&#8217;s another coincidence; but
from what you&#8217;ve told me and the little I
saw of them both that day, I felt dead
sorry. Besides, life&#8217;s so short, and I hate&mdash;divorce.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You can&#8217;t mean it has come to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It hadn&#8217;t come, but it was coming fast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
She visited me first. From there she was going
straight to her father&mdash;to stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s horrible, simply horrible&mdash;and so unjustified!
You induced her, though, to go to
Chicago instead?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It was a compromise, a play for time. I
tried to get her to go back home, but she refused,
positively. The only alternative seemed to be to
get her away&mdash;quick.... Was I right?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I think so, under the circumstances.
But the trouble itself, I can&#8217;t understand yet&mdash;Was
it that abominable furniture?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Partly. At least that was the final straw, the
match to the fuse. The whole thing had been
gathering slowly for a long time. I didn&#8217;t get
the entire story, of course. She wasn&#8217;t exactly
coherent. It seems she ordered it on her own responsibility,
and when the goods were delivered&mdash;the
thing was merely inevitable, some time&mdash;that
was all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Inevitable? No. It was abominable of
Margery&mdash;unforgivable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that; in fact I&#8217;m inclined
to differ. I still maintain it was inevitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Inevitable fiddlesticks! Harry is the best-natured
man alive, and generous. He&#8217;s been too
generous, too easy; that&#8217;s the trouble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Generous?&#8217;&#8221; gently. &#8220;&#8216;Generous?&#8217;...
Is it generous for a man with nothing and no
prospect of anything to take a girl out of a
home where money was never a consideration,
and transplant her into another where practically
it is the only thought?... &#8216;Generous&#8217;
for his own pleasure, to undertake to teach her
a financial lesson he knew to a moral certainty
in advance she could never learn? Do you honestly
call that &#8216;generous&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But she could learn. It&mdash;was her duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Duty!&#8221; Roberts laughed tolerantly. &#8220;Is
&#8216;duty&#8217; in the dictionary you use a synonym for
&#8216;cooking&#8217; and &#8216;scrubbing&#8217; and &#8216;drudgery&#8217;? Is
that your interpretation?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sometimes&mdash;in this case, yes; for a time.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Permanently, you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; for a time&mdash;until Harry got on his
feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He&#8217;ll never get on his feet unaided. Instead
he&#8217;ll get more and more wobbly all the time.
The past proves the future. He&#8217;s proved it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re simply horrid.&#8221; There were real
tears in the girl&#8217;s eyes now, not a mere premonition.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I ever told you anything about
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know I&#8217;m horrid, grant it. A friend I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
once had told me I was a fish,&mdash;cold-blooded
like one. Nature made me that way, you see,
so I can&#8217;t help it. And still I&#8217;m inclined to believe
if Mrs. Randall had chanced to select any
other lawyer in town there&#8217;d be a real separation,
instead of one in prospect, right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason looked up penitently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said simply. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; equally simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re so blunt and logical though; so&mdash;abstract.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I am that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl drew a long breath. Seemingly, after
all, the victory was hers.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, what are we going to do about it? We,
their friends, have to do something.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the question&mdash;what?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Margery will never go back now of herself.
I know her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; she&#8217;ll never go back of herself, never.
Do you blame her?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No answer. The query was sudden.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Honest, do you blame her?&#8221; insistently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I thought I did. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Does &#8216;love, honor, and obey&#8217; mean &#8216;wash,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
bake, and scrub&#8217; to a girl who has never in her
life before done any of the three?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Would you, if you were in her place, come
back&mdash;would you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I?&#8221; It was almost a gasp. &#8220;I&#8217;m not like
Margery. I&#8217;ve counted pennies all my life.&#8221; A
sudden flame. &#8220;But why do you bring me in?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why? That&#8217;s true. I had no right. I
apologize. To come back to Mrs. Randall. Do
you still blame her?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe I do. I ought to, I feel
that; but I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s tangled, tangled!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s the first symptom of divorce.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl flashed him a sudden look.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you hate divorce. You just said so.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;From the bottom of my soul. I meant it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Miss Gleason flashed a second look. Suddenly,
unaccountably, she held the reins.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What&#8217;s to be done then? Margery is as she
is, we both know that; and&mdash;and Harry loves
her, we both know that, too. What do you
suggest?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I?&#8221; Roberts smiled, his slow smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m
her lawyer and&mdash;abstract. Besides, her father
is wealthy. There&#8217;d be a fat fee if she returned
to him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You forget that I apologized.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m always forgetting.&#8221; Apparently
he did not remember even yet.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve neglected to answer my question,&#8221;
impatiently. &#8220;I repeat: what are you going to
do about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I asked your solution first. Do you give it
up?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; with a little gesture; &#8220;I give it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts smiled; a contagious, convincing
smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll try then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t
promise anything. I&#8217;ll simply try.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Try how?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Roberts smiled; but through whimsically
narrowed lids now.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure of the details yet myself. I
merely have an idea. There&#8217;s an old adage concerning
Mahomet and the mountain, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And in this case Margery represents the
mountain?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Unconsciously the girl&#8217;s color heightened.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You really fancy,&#8221; swiftly, &#8220;that Harry can
be stirred up enough, can be made practical
enough&mdash;you forget you said a moment ago
that he would never advance financially.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. The adage will have to be adjusted
a bit to meet the requirements. He&#8217;ll have to
be carried there.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason drew a quick little breath of
understanding and something more.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If you&#8217;ll do this for one almost a stranger,
one wonders what you would do for a friend,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;one&mdash;wonders.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant the man said nothing; abruptly,
dismissing the subject, he arose.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s just one other thing that I meant
to tell you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;something that perhaps
you know already. I&#8217;m pretty busy and I
don&#8217;t always find time to read the local news.
So it&#8217;s not unusual that I didn&#8217;t know before.
Steve Armstrong is back.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Quietly the girl arose also, stood so very still.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s been back a week.
He&#8217;s working in the big drug-store on the corner,
Shaw&#8217;s place, in the laboratory.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s all, then. I thought perhaps you
didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant the girl was silent; she looked
her companion full in the face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He called the afternoon he came. He was
almost&mdash;pitiable. Father came home finally.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Their eyes held. Not three feet separate they
stood there; but neither stirred.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mr. Roberts.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In silence the man put on top-coat and gloves;
not hastily, nor yet lingeringly. Equally naturally
he picked up his hat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;December the sixth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One whole
year. To-morrow will be the seventh&mdash;and
business&mdash;battle, again.&#8221; For the first time
he dallied, the big soft felt hat turning absently
in his hand. &#8220;Somehow I&#8217;d hoped a lot for the
sixth, planned a lot&mdash;and now it&#8217;s past.&#8221; His
eyes shifted, fastened elsewhere compellingly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It is all past, all over, gone into history,
isn&#8217;t it, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s past, Mr. Roberts.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not even &#8216;past, Darley,&#8217; not even that&mdash;yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The brown eyes dropped. They had fought
their fight and won&mdash;for December the sixth.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. Not even that&mdash;yet,&#8221; she said.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>ACQUAINTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
At the corner next beyond the Gleason home
Darley Roberts caught the nine o&#8217;clock
car, and remained on it until the end of the
division, practically the extreme opposite edge
of the town, was reached. He was the last
passenger to leave, and as the motorman was
reversing the trolley he paused a moment in the
vestibule.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Normal load was it, Johnson?&#8221; he asked
the conductor. &#8220;You rang up twenty-four
fares, I noticed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man looked consciously surprised to be
called by name.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, Mr. Roberts,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we carry anywhere
between twenty and thirty at this time
of night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How about the next trip, nine-thirty?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Better yet if anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And the next, the last?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Best of all. The straps are nearly always
loaded.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts buttoned up his coat deliberately.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Think it would pay to run a couple of hours
longer?&#8221; he asked, and this time the conductor
all but flushed at the unexpected confidence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;m sure it would, Mr. Roberts;
especially when the school&#8217;s in session. The
boys would ride half the night if they could.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There seems to be a good deal in that. By
the way, you have only one shift on this car
now, I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the long-hoped-for opportunity and
Johnson grew eloquent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Right you are, and it&#8217;s the dog&#8217;s life for
us men. I&#8217;ve had only one hot meal a day
since I took the job.&#8221; He searched the impassive
face before him with a glance. &#8220;If the
schedule was stretched a little, now, at either
end and a second shift added&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea. I&#8217;m glad it occurred
to you. Better speak to the superintendent
about it yourself; he&#8217;ll see the point.&#8221; Roberts
alighted deliberately. &#8220;Any suggestion you
men in the service make is valuable.&#8221; As he
vanished up the street toward his destination,
in the fulness of knowledge that the contemplated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
suggestion had been decided from the
turning of the first wheel on the system, he left
behind him a man imbued with an <i>esprit de corps</i>
that was to grow and leaven the entire working
force. It took but a minute all told!
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Five minutes later, in the half dark doorway
of a cottage on a side street, he was face to
face with Harry Randall.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me if I intrude,&#8221; he was saying,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m going out of town to-morrow and I
wish to talk with you a bit before I go. Can
you spare me a little time?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly.&#8221; Randall&#8217;s manner was decidedly
stiff. Nevertheless he led the way through the
vestibule and living-room to the dining-room beyond.
There he halted significantly. &#8220;By the
way,&#8221; he began, &#8220;the furniture I mentioned&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Damn the furniture!&#8221; Roberts met his
host&#8217;s look steadily. &#8220;You know me better
than that, by reputation if nothing more. I
said I wished to talk with you. May I?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall colored, and the stiffness vanished as
by a miracle.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a sort of
den upstairs where I do my work.&#8221; Again he
led the way. &#8220;My wife&#8217;s out of town, though,
now, and things are a bit mussy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts made no comment, and they mounted
the stairs in silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Inside the room the visitor swept the place
with a single all-including glance. Thereafter,
apparently, he observed nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;First of all, then,&#8221; he initiated bluntly, &#8220;do
I intrude? If so, I can tell my business in five
minutes; if not, we might possibly become
acquainted.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Randall colored; then he smiled, his
saving quality.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not in the least. It&#8217;s Friday night, you
know. In addition I was a bit lonely. I&#8217;m
distinctly glad to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Which, interpreted, means glad to see any
one.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I suppose so.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant the old odd smile shone in
Roberts&#8217; eyes, then it disappeared, leaving them
normal, inscrutable.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To begin with, then, I came primarily to
talk about Steve Armstrong. I believe he&#8217;s a
friend of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; A halt, then the query direct returned.
&#8220;Is he of yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that question later, if you please.
At least he&#8217;s the one adult to date I can remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
who ever called me by my first name.
Did you know that he&#8217;d returned to town?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. He was here last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Responsible, was he?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mr. Roberts!&#8221; Randall flushed like a
woman with strangers. &#8220;Pardon me, but there
are some questions I can&#8217;t answer&mdash;at least
until you answer my own of a moment
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understand perfectly. Also, contrary to
your suspicion, I didn&#8217;t avoid your question
to make it difficult for you. It requires two to
be friends. Enmities I, personally, have none.
Life&#8217;s too short and too busy. If it will assist
you any, I met Armstrong in the street this
evening face to face, and he declined to speak.
I judge he&#8217;s no friend to me. Am I any more
clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you wish to answer my question now,
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I judge you have a good reason for asking.
He was not responsible, wholly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not even decently so?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Hardly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I gathered as much from his appearance
to-night. It was the first time I&#8217;d seen him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
in nearly a year. You know the whole story
between Armstrong and myself, I take it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; once more.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And your sympathy is naturally with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It has been.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And now&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The smile that made Randall&#8217;s face boyish
came into being.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m deferring judgment now&mdash;and observing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I fear I can&#8217;t help you much there,&#8221; said
Darley, shortly. &#8220;I wished to discuss the future
a bit, not the past. The last time I talked with
Armstrong he was impossible. I think you
know what I mean. All men are that way when
they lose their nerve and drown the corpse.
What I wish to ask of you is whether the thing
was justified. I&#8217;m not artistic. I don&#8217;t brag
of it&mdash;I admit it. You&#8217;re different; your opinion
is of value. Commercially, he&#8217;s an impossibility.
He couldn&#8217;t hold a place if he had it&mdash;any
place. I don&#8217;t need to tell you that
either. As a writer&mdash;can he write, or can&#8217;t
he?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Harry Randall took off his big eyeglasses
and polished one lens and then the other.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;In my opinion, yes&mdash;and no.&#8221; He held the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
glasses to the light, seemed satisfied, and placed
them carefully on his nose. &#8220;A great writer&mdash;he&#8217;ll
never be that. It takes nerve and infinite
patience to be anything great, and Steve invariably
loses his nerve too soon. He lacks just
that much of being big. As for ability, the
spark&mdash;he&#8217;s got it, Roberts, as certainly as
you and I are sitting here. Elementally, he&#8217;s a
child and will always remain a child. I think
most artists are more or less so. Children can&#8217;t
bear criticism or delay&mdash;uncertain delay&mdash;that&#8217;s
Steve. On the other hand, if he were encouraged,
kept free on the financial side, left at liberty
to work when he felt the mood, and then
only, then&mdash;I realize it&#8217;s a big &#8216;if&#8217; and a big
contract for some one&mdash;he&#8217;d make good. Have
I answered your question?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. And here&#8217;s another: Is it worth
while?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To bolster him, you mean; to &#8216;pull him out
of the mud,&#8217; to use his own phrase?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; that would be a waste of energy. I
mean to keep him out permanently, to continue
pulling indefinitely.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a long time the two men sat in silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;God knows,&#8221; said Randall at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
asked myself the same question for years&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
couldn&#8217;t answer it. It&#8217;s as big as the universe.
Steve is simply an atom. It&#8217;s unanswerable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the pause following Roberts lit one of the
seemingly inexhaustible black cigars, after proffering
its mate. Again the two sat there, the
blue haze of mutual understanding gathering
between them.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I say it&#8217;s unanswerable,&#8221; repeated Randall.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the old problem of the young supporting
the uselessly old, the well serving the incurably
diseased. It means eternal vigilance from some
one, eternal sacrifice. It&#8217;s insoluble, neither
more nor less.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Roberts. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found it so&mdash;insoluble.
Particularly so in this case.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Slowly Randall&#8217;s glance lifted, met the other&#8217;s
eyes. That instant, as a flame is born, came
full understanding between them.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, particularly so in this case,&#8221; echoed
Roberts; &#8220;for it means a woman&#8217;s sacrifice, one
particular woman&#8217;s sacrifice. Nothing else in
the world will do&mdash;nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the beginning of personal confidence,
the halting-point for conversation between these
two. Both knew it and neither crossed the line.
They merely waited until a digression should
come naturally. Roberts it was who at last introduced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
it, and in a manner so matter of fact
that the other was all but deceived.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Has Armstrong been doing anything lately
in a literary way&mdash;anything, I mean, that justifies
your opinion?&#8221; he asked abruptly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not that I know of; absolutely nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re relying, then, on past impressions
merely.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; specifically the last novel he wrote,&mdash;the
one of a year or a year and a half or so
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t by any chance a copy of the
manuscript, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You could doubtless get it, however?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think so&mdash;unless some time he became
morbid and burned it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t done that; I know him. He
might threaten; but to do it&mdash;he&#8217;d as probably
go hungry. Get it some time, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I will if you request. You don&#8217;t wish it
for yourself, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not for myself. Perhaps not at all.
I&#8217;ve not decided yet. Anyway get it, please,
and be ready if I should ask.&#8221; He flashed a
look no man had ever questioned, could question.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t doubt my motive?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. The manuscript will be ready. I&#8217;ll
answer for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No further question of interest was asked, no
additional hint of purpose proffered. The subject
merely dropped, as in the beginning it had
merely begun. In some ways they were similar,
these two men in general so dissimilar.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I had another object in calling to-night,&#8221;
said Roberts, and again the announcement was
made without preface. &#8220;The opportunity to
buy a house presented itself to-day and I accepted.
Perhaps you know the place,&mdash;J. C.
Herbert&#8217;s, on top of the hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Open wonder spoke in the voice, open
mystification. &#8220;Yes, I know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s been vacant for some time. I moved
this afternoon, just into a couple of rooms. My
boy is there now trying to warm up the place;
but even then it won&#8217;t be particularly inviting.
Besides, I&#8217;m out of town quite a bit and in the
future am likely to be called away still more.
It occurred to me that if I could find some
married people whom I trusted, who would take
a personal interest in it and make it a home,
it would be pleasanter for me than being tucked
away in a couple of rooms alone and the rest
of the barn empty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; repeated Randall, impersonally, &#8220;I
think I appreciate your point of view. It&#8217;s a
little cheerless to be in a house alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t expect to interfere with them
in any way,&#8221; Roberts drifted on, &#8220;or live with
them&mdash;nothing of the kind. As I said, I probably
shouldn&#8217;t even be there much; only at
night. I&#8217;d expect to keep it up&mdash;coal and
light and that sort of thing&mdash;just the same as
I would have to do if I were alone. I&#8217;d naturally
wish to help furnish it, too; the things
that would inevitably fit in with it and wouldn&#8217;t
fit any place else. But the main thing would
be to have somebody about to make my own
corner livable, to sort of humanize the place.
You catch my idea?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I think so.&#8221; Harry Randall&#8217;s hand
was on his bald spot, caressing it absently.
&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; he repeated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a big place, even larger than I remembered,
when I went through it to-day,&#8221; went
on Roberts again. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take considerable help
to keep it up and some one will have to be
about constantly to direct. I have the help in
mind right now, competent too&mdash;I meet a lot
of people in various ways and I&#8217;ve had the thing
on my mind; but the supervision&mdash;it&#8217;s simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
out of the question with me at the present.&#8221;
He faced the other, looked at him straight.
&#8220;Would you and Mrs. Randall care to accept
the place as a home in return for taking the
responsibility of up-keep from me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the pause following Harry Randall&#8217;s face
went slowly red. Equally directly he met the
other&#8217;s look.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me, Mr. Roberts,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
Mrs. Randall and myself are not exactly objects
of charity yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts&#8217; expression did not alter by
so much as the twitching of a muscle.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That was unjustified, Mr. Randall,&#8221; he said
evenly, &#8220;and you know it. Let me explain a
bit further. I happen to have a house, but no
home. By the same chance you are able to produce
the reverse. Just why should it be an
offence upon my part to suggest bringing the
two together&mdash;for the mutual benefit of us
both?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why? Because it&#8217;s unequal, it&#8217;s patronage;
and though I work for twelve hundred
dollars a year, I&#8217;m still American born.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Granted&mdash;the latter remark. I&#8217;m also
American born, in the remotest corner of the
most God-forsaken county in&mdash;I won&#8217;t name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
the State; I might hurt some one&#8217;s feelings.&#8221;
Roberts&#8217; big fingers were twitching in a way
they had when something he had decided to do
met with opposition. &#8220;Nevertheless I hope
that fact doesn&#8217;t make me wholly unreasonable.
When it comes to patronage, we&#8217;re all
patronized: you do a kindness for a friend,
without remuneration, and he accepts it; that&#8217;s
patronage. The University gives you a position
as professor, out of a dozen applicants who
could do equally well, and you accept gladly.
That&#8217;s favoritism, another word for patronage.
A client comes to me and pays a fee for doing
a certain labor, when my competitor across the
street would perform it equally capably, and
for perhaps a smaller fee. That&#8217;s patronage.
You patronize your tailor when you order a suit
of clothes, the butcher when you buy a beefsteak.
It&#8217;s the basis of life, elemental. The
very air you breathe is patronage. It costs you
nothing, and you give nothing adequate in return.
To characterize patronage as un-American,
stultifying, is preposterous. Even if it were true
in this case, you&#8217;d have to give another reason
for offence. I refuse to consider it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, unbusinesslike then, if that is better.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unbusinesslike? Wait. In company with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
three other men I&#8217;m developing a silver mine
down in Arizona. The mining claim belongs
to a fifth man, belongs to him absolutely. He
knows the metal is there as well as we do; but
it&#8217;s down under the ground, locked up tight
in a million tons of rock. As it is now, so far
as he&#8217;s concerned, it might as well be on Mars.
If left to himself alone he&#8217;d live and die and
it would still be there. He hasn&#8217;t the ability
nor the means to make it of use. The other
three men and myself have. We can develop
it, and will; to our own purposes, share and
share alike. According to your notion there&#8217;s
patronage somewhere; but exactly where? Point
me the offence?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Harry Randall caressed his bald crown.
The argument was convincing, almost.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The cases are not parallel,&#8221; he combated
weakly, &#8220;not even similar.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why not?&#8221; shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m no longer
a young man particularly. I&#8217;ve never had a
place that I could call home in my life; never
for a day that I can remember. I want one
now, fancy I see the possibility of making one;
a place where I can keep a friend now and then
if I wish, where I could even order in a supper
and entertain if I saw fit. I chance to have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
ability to pay for the privilege, and am willing
to pay. That&#8217;s my affair. You chance to be
able to make that home possible&mdash;and incidentally
enjoy it yourself. It&#8217;s like the silver mine,&mdash;mutual
benefit, share and share alike. The
cases seem to me parallel, quite parallel.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Opposite Harry Randall sat very still. In
absent forgetfulness he polished the big glasses
the second time and sprung them back carefully
on his nose. But even yet he did not answer,
merely sat there waiting; awaiting the moment
to counter, to refute.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Am I not right?&#8221; asked Roberts, bluntly.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the proposition logical?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Logical, yes. The logic is very good.&#8221;
Randall glanced up keenly. The moment for
which he had been waiting had come, more
quickly than he had expected. &#8220;So <i>good</i> in
fact that I see but one fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time the keen eyes smiled, very candidly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The sole fault, so far as I can see, is that
you don&#8217;t believe in it yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the space wherein one could count ten
slowly the two men looked at each other; slowly,
in turn, on Roberts&#8217; firm fighter&#8217;s face there
formed a smile, a peculiar, appreciative smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Granted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I admit failure.&#8221; The
smile passed like a dropped curtain. &#8220;Moreover
be assured I shall not dissimulate again.
As a friend, or whatever you wish, however, I
advise you to think carefully before you refuse
an offer made in good faith and to your own
advantage.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Listening, Harry Randall straightened. His
lips closed tightly for a second. &#8220;You mean, I
presume,&#8221; the words were painfully exact, &#8220;to
remind me that you hold my note for four
hundred dollars, and to imply&mdash;&#8221; he halted
significantly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment the other man said nothing,
the face of him told nothing. Then deliberately,
from an inner pocket, he drew out a leather
wallet, from the wallet a strip of paper, and
held it so the other could read. Still without
a word he tore it to bits.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The devil take your note!&#8221; he observed, succinctly
and without heat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mr. Roberts, you&mdash;&#8221; Randall&#8217;s face was
crimson, &#8220;you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;that, then, really?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts said nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for the confidence, believe me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
It&#8217;s not misplaced, either. Accept my assurance
of that too.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;My name is Roberts, not Shylock. I told
you before I am American born, of American
parents.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; abjectly. The red had
left Randall&#8217;s face and in its place, as on a
mirror, was forming another look, of comprehension&mdash;and
more. &#8220;Yet you&mdash;advised; and
if not that&mdash;&#8221; of a sudden he got to his feet.
Something was coming he knew to a certainty&mdash;something
unexpected, vital&mdash;and he felt
better able so to meet it. &#8220;Just what did you
mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts was studying him deliberately, with
the peculiar analytical look Armstrong of old
had known so well.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You can&#8217;t imagine yet,&#8221; he queried, &#8220;not
with the motive you fancied eliminated?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You wish to do me a kindness, a disinterested
kindness. For what reason?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Cut out my motive, providing I have one,
for the present. It&#8217;s immaterial.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t help&mdash;I can&#8217;t conceive&mdash;&#8221;
On a sudden came a flash of light that augmented
to a blaze. &#8220;Can it concern Margery
and me? Is that it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts did not look up. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know, then,&#8221; tensely. &#8220;How much?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Everything.&#8221; Roberts inspected the wall-paper
opposite as though interested. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
permit me I&#8217;ll help you to avoid an action for
divorce.&#8221; A pause. &#8220;One, moreover, I can&#8217;t
help but feel somewhat justified.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For long, very long, there was silence absolute.
Then, adequate time having passed, apparently
Roberts lost interest in the wall pattern.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sit down, please,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;At last
it seems we understand each other. Let&#8217;s talk
things over a bit.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>FRIENDSHIP</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It had come about, that return of
composure, more quickly than a stranger would
have thought possible, perhaps more quickly
than the visitor had expected. At least for a
moment he did not follow the obvious lead.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Particularly I&#8217;m waiting for an explanation
of that word &#8216;justified&#8217; you used.&#8221; The
voice this time was low. &#8220;You recall you said
&#8216;justifiable action,&#8217; do you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Somewhat justifiable, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall looked straight before him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you agree with me?&#8221; added Roberts.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Frankly, no. I admit I&#8217;m biassed, however&mdash;at
least I trust I&#8217;m not a cad, unable to
acknowledge a deficiency when shown.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Or to administer the remedy, providing that
remedy is proved innocuous?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I trust that also.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, we&#8217;ll return to &#8216;justifiable&#8217; qualified.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
It will make things easier perhaps. You
don&#8217;t wonder how I happen to know about
your trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There could be only one explanation.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you. That simplifies matters also.&#8221;
A halt; then the fundamental question direct:
&#8220;Will you trust me to help you, trust me
unqualifiedly?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; no hesitation, no amplification, just
that single word, &#8220;yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Darley Roberts remained for a moment quite
still.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you, again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have had
few compliments in my life, and that is one.&#8221;
Again he sat quite still, all but the great
hands, the only feature of him that ever showed
restlessness or rebellion. &#8220;To begin with,&#8221; he
resumed suddenly, &#8220;I am a lawyer, not a
preacher. My business is with marriage the
contract, not marriage the sacrament. Sentiment
has no place in law. Contracts are promises
to deliver certain tangible considerations;
otherwise there would be none. Again contracts
are specified or implied; but morally equally
binding, equally inviolable. In the eye of the
law when you married Margery Cooper you
contracted, by implication, to deliver certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
considerations, chief among them one purely
psychological&mdash;happiness. By implication you
did this. Is it not so?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, by implication.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Have you fulfilled that contract?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I have tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The law does not recognize attempts.
We&#8217;re ignoring the Church and sentiment now.
Have you fulfilled your contract?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I failed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You admit it freely?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I can&#8217;t do otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Let&#8217;s drop the legal point of view then.
You know why you failed?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, and no. A contract carries a mutual
obligation. Margery failed also.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts flashed a look.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you desire a separation, too?&#8221; incisively.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, God, no!&#8221; It was sudden panic. &#8220;I
love her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And she loves you,&#8221; evenly. &#8220;She&#8217;ll return,
unquestionably&mdash;and in the future will
go again as inevitably, unless you fulfil your
contract. It&#8217;s life.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Harry Randall stared straight before
him, the weight of the universe suddenly on his
shoulders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Fulfill&mdash;&#8221; he halted. &#8220;Supposing I can&#8217;t
fulfill?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wait. We&#8217;ll discuss that in a moment.
First, you admit there was a certain justification
for what she has done?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No rebellion this time, no false pride.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; simply; &#8220;you were right. I admit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The contract of implied happiness then; you
failed because&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall completed the sentence as was intended.
&#8220;Because we could not live, cannot live, as
Margery demands, upon what it is possible for me
to make. There is absolutely no other reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She is extravagant, you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For the wife of one in my position, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask you that. Is she extravagant,
for herself as she is?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Against his will the first suggestion of color
showed on Randall&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I fail to see the distinction,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;In other words,&#8221; remorselessly, &#8220;you question
my right to wield the probe. You prefer
not to be hurt even to effect a cure.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I repeat that I&#8217;m not a cad. Besides,
I&#8217;ve told you I trust you. When a woman
marries a man, though, with her eyes open&mdash;&#8221;
He caught himself. &#8220;Pardon me, I&#8217;m ashamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
to have said that. To answer your question:
no; Margery wasn&#8217;t extravagant in the least
by her standard.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean by &#8216;her standard,&#8217;&#8221; apparently
Roberts had heard only the last sentence, &#8220;the
habit and experience of her whole life, of twenty-two
years of precedent when you married her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And of generations of inheritance back of
that. The Coopers are an old stock and have
always been moderately wealthy, have they not?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, back as far as the record goes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very good. Can you, by any stretch of the
imagination, fancy Mrs. Randall, being as she
is, ever living happily in an atmosphere so different
from that she has known, which time and
circumstance have made her own? Can you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221; The voice was low again, very low.
&#8220;In my sane moments, never.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts waited deliberately, until the pause
added emphasis; with equal deliberation he drove
the wedge home.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still, in the fulness of this knowledge,
you contracted by implication to deliver to her
this same thing&mdash;happiness,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A second Harry Randall waited, then unconsciously
he passed his hand across his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he echoed, &#8220;in the fulness of knowledge
I did it. I loved her.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Loved? And yet you sacrificed her! And
on top of that again labelled her rebellion unjustified!&#8221;
He was silent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Harry Randall&#8217;s hand passed across
his face, and this time it came back damp.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;God, you&#8217;re hard on me!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I deserve
it, though, and more. She was ignorant
absolutely of what it meant to count pennies and
deny herself. She couldn&#8217;t realize, couldn&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts said nothing. The leaven was working.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I hoped, deluded myself with the belief, that
it would be different; yet from the first I knew
better. I was to blame absolutely. I simply
loved her, as I do now&mdash;that was all.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; This time the voice was gentle, unbelievably
gentle. &#8220;I think I understand&mdash;think
I do. Anyway,&#8221; the voice was matter of
fact again, startlingly, perhaps intentionally, so,
&#8220;we&#8217;re wandering from the point. The past
is dead. Let&#8217;s bury it and look into the future.
Do you see the solution yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall looked up swiftly. He smiled; the
smile of a noncombatant.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I see it; I can&#8217;t help seeing it; but&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
The sentence completed itself in a gesture of
impotency confessed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, don&#8217;t!&#8221; The annoyance was
not simulated. &#8220;It&#8217;s unforgivable.... You&#8217;re
healthy, are you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And strong?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Reasonably.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, what more can you ask? The world&#8217;s
full of work; avalanches of it, mountains of it.
It seems as though there never was so much to
be done as now, to-day; and the world will
pay, pay if you&#8217;ll do it. Can&#8217;t you see light?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall caught himself in time to prevent a
second gesture.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, frankly, I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve tried, but I&#8217;m
fundamentally incapable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts&#8217; great fighting face flashed about.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve tried&mdash;how?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall hesitated, and once again the color
mounted his cheek.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I do my work here in the department the best
I can, creditably, I think; but still there isn&#8217;t
much to look forward to, nothing adequate.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And that&#8217;s as far as you&#8217;ve tried?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I have no other training.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts looked at him, merely looked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No other training!... You fancy this
little university, this little bounded, contracted
circle, is the world? You&#8217;ve tried! Let me see
your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Higher and higher mounted the tell-tale color;
obedient as a schoolboy Randall obeyed. Something
compelled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Roberts looked and turned away. &#8220;A
woman&#8217;s hands; I fancied so.... And you
hoped to fulfil your contract, defied fate&mdash;with
those hands!&#8221; His own worked, and under
command went still. &#8220;You agreed to let me
help you, did you not?&#8221; he digressed suddenly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And promised to trust me? I wish that
understood clearly in the beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well, then, that brings us back to the
starting-point. I repeat my proposal that Mrs.
Randall and you change your residence immediately.
Must I analyze further?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I understand&mdash;and appreciate. I accept
too if Margery&mdash;&#8221; he halted with a wry
smile. &#8220;Do you think she&mdash;would if I asked
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts&#8217; expression did not alter. &#8220;Supposing
you write her and find out,&#8221; he suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
&#8220;And in the meantime you&#8217;ll have three days to
settle in your new home,&#8221; he added irrelevantly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Randall colored, like a youth planning
on building his first nest. The contagion of the
thing was upon him, the infinite, rosy possibilities
manifest.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I can do it easily,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and she&#8217;ll be
surprised&mdash;and pleased&mdash;I can fancy the way
she&#8217;ll look now.&#8221; Second thought intruded.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid, though, the few things we&#8217;ve got
here won&#8217;t even make an impression there. The
place is so big by comparison.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; easily. &#8220;I said I&#8217;d want
to take a hand.&#8221; He had a seeming inspiration.
&#8220;Supposing you get Miss Gleason to help you
and suggest what more is needed. I&#8217;m sure
she&#8217;d do it for Mrs. Randall and you. I&#8217;ll
speak to her too.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Just the thing. I&#8217;d like that immensely.
No one can help that way like Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Let&#8217;s consider it settled then.&#8221; His point
carried, Roberts&#8217; great hands were loose in his
lap again. &#8220;I had just one other matter I
wished to speak about to-night. How&#8217;d you
like to accept a position under me with the new
company?&#8221; He did not elaborate this time, did
not dissimulate. &#8220;I&#8217;ll personally guarantee you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
four thousand a year, beginning January first,
with three weeks&#8217; vacation.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How would I like it!&#8221; For the third time
Harry Randall fell to polishing his glasses; but
this time, in spite of an effort to prevent, his
hand shook visibly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to ask
me that. It would be a miracle; only&mdash;only
I&#8217;m a bit afraid of a position of that kind&mdash;afraid
it would be too big.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The company would expect you to earn it,
of course,&#8221; impassively.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But I&#8217;m not worth it. I know that and I
don&#8217;t want to accept under false representations.
It&#8217;s beyond me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Beyond nothing!&#8221; curtly. &#8220;If I say you&#8217;re
worth it, you are. I&#8217;ll make you so&mdash;help if
necessary. Do you accept?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Accept, yes, and thank you. I won&#8217;t protest,
or presume to misunderstand your intent
in offering it to me. I realize you&#8217;re giving
me a chance to make good where I failed to
fulfil my obligation with Margery.&#8221; The voice
was not so steady as it might have been and for
an instant Randall halted. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind,
though,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask you a
question. I can&#8217;t conceive why you, a stranger,
practically, should do all this for me. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
simply confused, it&#8217;s all so unprecedented. Why
do you do it, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Into Darley Roberts&#8217; eyes crept the old odd
smile that spread no farther.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean it&#8217;s all so unprecedented&mdash;of
me,&#8221; he returned bluntly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall said nothing. It was true.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that what you meant?&#8221; he repeated,
and just for a second the smile crept beyond
the eyes.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s useless to lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&mdash;To me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time Randall&#8217;s face flamed undeniably.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes&mdash;to you,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;You&#8217;re positively
uncanny.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it then,&#8221; shortly, &#8220;ever. To answer
your question: The main reason, I think,
is because to-day is December the sixth&mdash;a
holiday.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A holiday!&#8221; Randall stared, as in the
morning Herbert had stared.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;With me.... Another reason is that I&#8217;ve
been an under dog myself for a very long time
and&mdash;perhaps, though, I am mistaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m one of the breed unquestionably.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And under dogs have a fondness for each
other instinctively.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall held his peace. He had the quality
of presentiment and it was active now.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There was still a third reason.&#8221; No smile
in the blue eyes now, just an impassive blank.
&#8220;I had a call a few days ago from an upper
dog, by heredity. He offered me a thousand
dollars cold not to do&mdash;what I&#8217;ve just done.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall was not a good gambler. His face
whitened to the lips.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You refer to Margery&#8217;s father,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. It seemed to me well, under the circumstances,
for you to know. He was strongly
in favor of letting matters drift. I gathered
he has never been particularly fond of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, never. But Margery&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understand absolutely. Take this for what
it is worth from a disinterested observer: Your
wife is square, man, from the ground up. Don&#8217;t
ever for an instant, because you were reared
differently and have a different point of view,
fancy otherwise. Tote your end of the load fair&mdash;I
believe you see how now&mdash;and she&#8217;ll tote
hers. It&#8217;ll be worth your while.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Roberts!&#8221; Randall was upon his feet, he
could not do otherwise. &#8220;Honestly I don&#8217;t know
how to thank you. Anything that I can say,
can do even&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t try, please. I&#8217;d rather you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
No pretence in that frank aversion, no affectation.
He arose as one whose labor is over.
&#8220;Let it go at that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In sheer perplexity Randall frowned. His
hands sought his pockets.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But, confound it, I don&#8217;t like to. It&#8217;s so
inhumanly ungrateful.&#8221; The frown deepened.
&#8220;Besides, when this intoxication is off I&#8217;ll realize
what a lot I&#8217;m accepting from you. That
house, for instance. You didn&#8217;t buy a place of
that kind for an investment or for yourself
alone. I&#8217;m not an absolute ass. You&#8217;ll want
it all some of these times, and then&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Slowly Roberts faced about; equally slowly
he smiled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Would it relieve your mind any,&#8221; he finally
asked, &#8220;if I were to promise to tell you the
moment I do want it&mdash;all?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, a lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I give you my word then.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thanks. I believe that too; but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the second time Roberts smiled, the smile
of finality unquestionable.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Must we return and go through it all
again?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s after midnight now,
but if you wish&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; not that either.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll send the office-boy around
in the morning to help you move. He has
nothing else really to do.&#8221; Roberts paused at
a sudden thought. &#8220;By the way, I&#8217;ll not be
back until a week from to-morrow. Suppose
we have a little housewarming, just we four&mdash;strangers,
that night?&#8221; and before the other
could answer, before the complex suggestion in
its entirety took effect, he was gone.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>COMPREHENSION</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon of a
sultry July Sunday when a big red roadster
drew up all but noiselessly and, with an instinct
common to all motorists, a heritage from an
equine age past, stopped at the nose of the
hitching-post in front of the Gleason cottage.
In it the single occupant throttled down the
engine until it barely throbbed. Alighting, goggles
on forehead, he passed up the walk toward
the house. Not until he was fairly at the steps
did he apparently notice his surroundings. Then,
unexpectedly, he bared his head.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Be not surprised, it is I,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not
in the spirit alone but in the flesh.&#8221; Equally
without warning he smiled. &#8220;Needless to say
I&#8217;m glad to see you again, Elice,&#8221; as he took
the girl&#8217;s offered hand. Then deliberately releasing
it: &#8220;and you too, Armstrong,&#8221; extending
his own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Precisely as, with his companion of the shady
porch, he had risen upon the newcomer&#8217;s advent,
the other man stood there. If possible his
face, already unnaturally pale for a torrid afternoon,
shaded whiter as an instant passed without
his making a motion in response.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you too, Armstrong,&#8221; Roberts repeated,
the smile still on his face, the hand still extended;
then, when there still came no response,
the voice lowered until it was just audible, but
nevertheless significant in its curt brevity:
&#8220;Shake whether you want to or not. There
are seven pairs of eyes watching from behind
that trellis across the street.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong obeyed as though moved by a
wire.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Speak loud, so they can all hear. They&#8217;re
listening too,&#8221; directed the low-voiced mentor.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong, red in the face now, formulated
the conventional.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Roberts sat down on the top
step, his big-boned body at ease, his great
bushy head, in which the gray was beginning to
sprinkle thick, a contrast to the dark pillar of
the porch. &#8220;I just returned an hour ago,&#8221;
he added as casually as though food for gossip
had not been avoided by a hair&#8217;s breadth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
was not still imminent. &#8220;It&#8217;s good, unqualifiedly,
to be back.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong returned to his seat, a bit uncertainly.
His hands were trembling uncontrollably;
in self-defence he thrust them deep into
his pockets.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Have you been out of town?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, for over a month.&#8221; No affectation in
that even friendliness. He laughed suddenly
in tolerant, all but impersonal, self-analysis.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m tired&mdash;tired until the marrow of
my bones aches.&#8221; He laughed again. &#8220;It
seems as though I never was so tired in my
life.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong looked at him, in a sudden flash
of the old confidence and admiration.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I beg your pardon, then,&#8221; he said hurriedly.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that you had been away, of
course, and rather fancied, from your coming so
unexpected&mdash;And that again after two years
almost&mdash;You can understand how it was possible,
can&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m ashamed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly I can understand,&#8221; easily. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
all forget it. I have already.&#8221; He smiled an
instant comprehensively fair into the blue eyes,
then characteristically abruptly he digressed.
&#8220;By the way, Elice,&#8221; he said, &#8220;can&#8217;t we have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
some of those cookies of yours? I&#8217;ve dreamed
of them, along with other things, until&mdash;Do,
please, if they&#8217;re in stock. I mean it. Still
down at Phelps&#8217;s are you?&#8221; he asked the other
directly when the girl had gone.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221; A long pause wherein Armstrong did
not look up. &#8220;I&mdash;left there a couple of weeks
ago. I&#8217;m not doing anything in particular just
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The cookies, far-famed and seemingly always
available, were on hand, and Roberts relapsed
into silence. From her own seat behind them
Elice Gleason sat looking at the two men, precisely
as she had looked that first evening they
had called in company.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s a new motor out there, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
she asked at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Roberts roused and shook the scattered
crumbs off his khaki coat. &#8220;It came while
I was away. This is the first try-out.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Miss Gleason was examining the big machine
with a critical eye. &#8220;This is a six-cylinder, I
judge. What&#8217;s become of the old four, Old&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Reliable?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Disgraced its name.&#8221; Roberts smiled peculiarly.
&#8220;I took it along with me when I went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
West. It&#8217;s scrapped out there on the Nevada
desert, God knows where, thirty miles from nowhere.
I fancy the vultures are wondering right
now what in the world it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You had an accident?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Rather.&#8221; Roberts got to his feet deliberately.
&#8220;Some other time I&#8217;ll tell you the story,
if you wish. It would take too long now, and
it&#8217;s entirely too hot here.&#8221; He looked at his
two listeners impartially. &#8220;Besides, there&#8217;s
other business more urgent. I have a curiosity
to see how quickly the six-eighty out there
will eat up thirty miles. It&#8217;s guaranteed to
do it in twenty-five minutes. Won&#8217;t you come
along?
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the rumble and you two sit forward,&#8221;
he added as they hesitated. &#8220;You can
drive as well as I can, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not to-day; some other time,&#8221; declined
Armstrong, hurriedly. He started up to avoid
a change of purpose, and to cover any seeming
precipitancy lit a cigarette with deliberation.
&#8220;I was going, really, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts did not insist, nor did he dissimulate.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As you wish. I meant it or I shouldn&#8217;t
have made the suggestion. Better glue on your
hair if you accept, Elice. I have a presentiment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
that I&#8217;ll let her out to-day.&#8221; He started
down the walk. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready when you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Behind him the man and the girl exchanged
one look.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Come, Steve,&#8221; said the girl in a low voice.
&#8220;I ask it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; Armstrong&#8217;s thin face formed a smile,
a forced, crooked smile; &#8220;I meant what I said,
too, or I wouldn&#8217;t have refused. Likewise I
also have a presentiment&mdash;of a different kind.
Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
And that was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Out in the long street, University Row, glided
the big red roadster; slowly through the city
limits, more rapidly through the suburbs, then,
as the open country beyond came to view, it
began gradually to find itself.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Want to see her go, do you, Elice?&#8221; asked
Roberts, as the town behind them grew indistinct
in a fog of dust.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If I wish.&#8221; Roberts brought the goggles
down from his forehead significantly. &#8220;If I
wish,&#8221; he repeated, the inflection peculiar. He
looked ahead. The broad prairie road, dust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
white in its July whiteness, stretched straight
out before them, without a turn or a curve, direct
as the crow flies for forty miles, and on through
two counties, as he knew. A light wind, begot
of their motion alone, played on their faces,
mingled with the throbbing purr of the engine
in their ears. &#8220;If I wish,&#8221; for the third time;
and notch by notch the throttle began to open.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
On they went, the self-evolved breeze a gale
now, the throb of the big motor a continuous
moan, the cloud of dust behind them a dull
brown bank against the sky. On they went over
convex grades that tilted gently first to the
right, then to the left, over culverts that spoke
one single note of protest, over tiny bridges that
echoed hollow at the impact; past dazzling green
cornfields and yellow blocks of ripening grain,
through great shadows of homestead groves and
clumps of willows that marked the lowest point
of swales, on&mdash;on&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts leaned over close, but his eyes did
not leave the road for the fraction of a second.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Afraid, girl?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the man looked ahead. They were fair
in the open now, already far from the city. It
was the heat of a blistering Sunday and not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
team or a pedestrian was astir. Ahead, for a
mile, for miles perhaps, as far as they could
see, not an animate dot marred the surface of
the taut, stretched, yellow-white ribbon.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Shall I let her out, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sure you&#8217;re not afraid&mdash;in the least?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the throttle lever and its companion
spark began to move around the tiny sextant,
approaching nearer and nearer. Simultaneously,
sympathetic, as though actuated by the
same power, the hand of the speedometer on
the dash began to crawl up and up. They had
been all but racing before; but now&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Behind them the cloud of dust rose higher
and higher, and darker and darker as the suction
increased. To either side was no longer
yellow and green distinct, but a mingling, indistinct,
mottled unreality. Ahead the ribbon of
yellow and white seemed to rise up and throw
itself into their faces; again and again endlessly.
The engine no longer moaned. It
roared as a fire under draft. The wind was
a wall that held them back like a vise in their
places. In the flash of a glance the man looked
at the face of the dial. The single arm was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
pasted black over the numeral sixty. Once more
the throttle advanced a notch, the spark lever
two&mdash;and the hand halted at sixty-five. The
wind gripped them afresh, and like human
fingers grappled with them. Up, fairly level
with their eyes, lifted the advancing yellow-white
ribbon. By his side, though he did not
look, the man knew that the girl had covered
her face with her hands, was struggling against
the gale to breathe. He was struggling himself,
through wide-opened nostrils, his lips locked
tight. On his bare hands the sweat gushed
forth and, despite the suction, glistened bright.
Yet once more, the last time the throttle moved,
the spark&mdash;and met on the sextant. With its
last ounce of power the great car responded,
thrilled; one could feel it, a vital thing. Once
again the speed-hand on the indicator stirred;
but this time the man did not see it, dared not
look even for the fraction of a second. Like
grim death, grim life, he clung to the wheel;
his eyes not on the road beneath but a quarter
of a mile ahead. About him the scuttling earth
shaded from motley to gray; but he did not
see. A solitary tree loomed ahead beside the
ribbon, and seemed to crack like a rifle report
as they flashed past. At the radiator vent a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
tiny cloud of steam arose, caught the gale, and
stung damp on his cheeks. Far ahead, then
nearer and nearer miraculously, a blot of green
that he knew was the tree fringe of a river,
took form, swept forward to meet them, came
nearer and nearer, arose like a wall&mdash;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Back into neutral, separating until they were
once more opposite, went the two companions
of the sextant. Simultaneously again the speed
indicator followed the backward trail. Incredibly
swift the gale dwindled, until it barely
fanned their cheeks. The roar of the great
engine subsided, until once more it was a gentle
murmur. The vivid green and the dull yellow
of summer took their respective places; and
like a live thing, beaten and cowed, the big car
drew up at the very edge of the grove, left the
yellow road-ribbon, rustled a moment amid the
half-parched grass and halted in the shadow
blot of a big water maple&mdash;thirty miles almost
to a rod from the city limits they had left.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment the two humans in the seat remained
in their places, breathing hard. Deliberately,
almost methodically, Roberts wiped the
sweat from his face.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thirty-two minutes, the clock says,&#8221; he
commented. &#8220;We dawdled though at first. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
the finish&mdash;&#8221; He looked at the indicator peculiarly.
&#8220;I&#8217;d really like to have known, for
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl stood up. She trembled a little.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Would you really? Perhaps&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You looked, Elice? I fancied you shut
your eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I did&mdash;only for a second. It read seventy-two.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts turned a switch and the last faint
purr ceased.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I imagined, almost, you&#8217;d be afraid,&#8221; he
said evenly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was&mdash;horribly,&#8221; simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You were; and still&mdash;I won&#8217;t do it again,
Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Without a word the girl stepped to the
ground. In equal silence the man followed.
Taking off the long khaki coat he spread it on
the ground amid the shadow and indicated his
handiwork with a nod. For a half-minute perhaps
he himself remained standing, however, his
great shoulders squared, his big fingers twitching
unconsciously. Recollecting, he dropped on
the grass beside her.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me, Elice,&#8221; he apologized bluntly,
&#8220;for frightening you.&#8221; He smiled, the infrequent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
tolerant, self-analytic smile. &#8220;I somehow
couldn&#8217;t help doing what I did. I knew
it would break out sometime soon. I couldn&#8217;t
help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment the girl inspected him, her
head, just lifted, resting on her locked arms,
her eyelids half closed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You knew&mdash;what? Something&#8217;s happened
I know; something unusual, very. I
never saw you before as you are to-day. I&#8217;d
almost say you had nerves. Do you care to
tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts was still smiling.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you care to have me tell you?&#8221; he
countered.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If I wish&mdash;if I wish&mdash;you told me that
once before, you recall.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I proceeded to frighten you&mdash;horribly.
You said so.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Does that mean you wish to be frightened
again? Do you enjoy it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Enjoy it? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m curious to
listen, if you care to tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts had stretched himself luxuriously on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
the cool sod. He looked up steadily, through
the tangled leaves, at the dotted blue beyond.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to frighten you this time,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Nothing to tell much, just&mdash;money.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I gathered as much.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And why, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Several reasons. First of all, a practical
man doesn&#8217;t carry an automobile half across the
continent by express without a definite stake
involved. Later he doesn&#8217;t &#8216;scrap,&#8217; as you say,
that same machine without regret unless the
stake was big&mdash;and won.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think I won, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And again, why?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl flashed a glance, but he was not
looking at her.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Because you always win,&#8221; she said simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Always?&#8221; A pause. &#8220;Always, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Always in matters of&mdash;money.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man lay there still, looking up. Barely a
leaf in the big maple was astir, not a single sensate
thing. Had they been the only two people
alive on a desert expanse they could not have
been more isolated, more completely alone. Yet
he pursued the lead no further, neither by word
nor suggestion. Creeping through a tiny gap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
a ray of sunlight glared in his eyes, and he
shifted enough to avoid it. That was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In her place the girl too shifted, just so
she could see him more distinctly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re really interested? I don&#8217;t care to
bore you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, really. I never pretend with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Slowly Roberts sat up, his head bare, his
fingers locked over his knees.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well. I &#8217;phoned, you remember, that
I was going West to look at a mining claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What I should have said, to be exact, was
that I was going to file on one, if it wasn&#8217;t
too late. I&#8217;d already seen it, on paper, and
ore from it; had it assayed myself. It ran
above two hundred dollars. It was one of those
things that happen outside of novels oftener
than people imagine. The man who furnished
the specimens was named Evans,&mdash;a big, raw-boned
cowboy I met down in the Southwest,
where I&#8217;ve got an interest in a silver mine.
He&#8217;d contracted the fever and worked for our
company for a time. When the Nevada craze
came on he got restless and wanted to go too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
He hadn&#8217;t a second shirt to his back so I grub-staked
him. Nothing came of it and I staked
him again. This time he came here personally
to report. He had some ore with him and a
map; just that and nothing more. Whether
he&#8217;d found anything worth while he didn&#8217;t
know, didn&#8217;t imagine he had, as it was a new
section that hadn&#8217;t produced as yet. He hadn&#8217;t
even taken the trouble to secure his claim.
What he wanted was more money, grub money;
and he had brought the specimen along as a
teaser. He swore he hadn&#8217;t mentioned the
matter to a soul except me. There wasn&#8217;t any
hurry either, he said, or danger. The prospect
was forty miles out on the desert from Tonopah,
no railroad nearer, and no one was interested
there much as yet. If I&#8217;d advance him another
thousand, though&mdash;I&#8217;d been backing him a
thousand dollars at a time&mdash;he&#8217;d go back and
file regular, and when I&#8217;d had an assay made,
if the thing looked good, he&#8217;d sell to me outright
for five thousand cash.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the first time the speaker halted, looked
at the listener directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Still interested, are you?&#8221; he queried. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all money, money from first to last.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, go on. I think I saw this man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Evans, didn&#8217;t I, around with you for several
days?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Possibly. I kept him here while I was getting
a report. I&#8217;d seen some ore before and
the scent looked warm to me. Besides, I knew
Evans, and under the circumstances I felt
better to keep him in sight. I did for a week,
night and day. He never left me for an hour.
He&#8217;d been eating my bread and salt for a year,
had every reason to be under obligation and
loyal, was so tentatively, his coming proved
that; but, while one has to trust others up
to a certain point in this world, beyond that&mdash;I&#8217;ve
found beyond that it&#8217;s better not to
take chances, even on obligation.... Have
you ever known anything of the kind yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl was not looking at him now. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had little experience with people,&#8221; she evaded,
&#8220;very little. Go on, please. I&#8217;m interested.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Well, the report came the day I &#8217;phoned
you, on the last delivery. Evans was killing
time, as usual, about the office and I called him
into my private room and locked the door. I
read it through to him aloud, every word; and,
he didn&#8217;t seem to take it all in at first, again.
All at once the thing came over him, the full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
meaning of that assay of two hundred dollars
to the ton&mdash;and he went to pieces, like a fly-wheel
that&#8217;s turned too fast. He simply caved.
For ten years he&#8217;d been chasing the rainbow
of chance, and now all at once, when he&#8217;d fairly
given up hope, he&#8217;d stumbled upon it and the
pot of gold together. It was too much for
him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;This was at five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, I
say. At six o&#8217;clock I unlocked the door and
things began to move definitely. What happened
in that hour doesn&#8217;t matter. It wasn&#8217;t
pleasant, and under the circumstances no one
would believe me if I told; for I had his written
promise to show me the ledge he&#8217;d found and
to sell whatever right he had to the claim himself
to me for twenty-five thousand dollars....
I found it, I have an incontestable title to it,
and I refused a million dollars flat for it less
than three days ago!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In her place the girl half raised, met the
speaker eye to eye.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still, knowing in advance it was worth
a fortune, Evans sold to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, voluntarily; begged it of me. I said
no one would believe me now, even you&mdash;I
don&#8217;t care for the opinion of any one else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt you, not for a second.&#8221; The
brown eyes had dropped now. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t
quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I repeat once more, no one can understand
who wasn&#8217;t there. He was crazy, avariciously
crazy. He wanted the money then, then;
wanted to see it, to feel it, that minute. It
was his and he wanted it; not the five thousand
he&#8217;d promised, but five times that. He
wouldn&#8217;t wait. He would have it.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I tried to reason with him, to argue with
him, offered him his own terms if he&#8217;d let me
develop it; but he wouldn&#8217;t listen. If I
wouldn&#8217;t accept he&#8217;d throw me over entirely,
notwithstanding the fact that I&#8217;d made the find
possible, and sell to some one else&mdash;sell something
he didn&#8217;t have; for at last it all came
out, why he&#8217;d gone crazy and wouldn&#8217;t wait.
He&#8217;d lied to me previously. Before he&#8217;d left
Tonopah he&#8217;d talked, told of his find to a half-dozen
of his friends, and left them specimens
of the same ore he&#8217;d brought me. He&#8217;d told
them everything, in fact, except the location. It
developed that he had retained judgment enough
to keep back even a hint of that; and they were
waiting for him there,&mdash;he knew it and I knew
it,&mdash;waiting his return, waiting to learn the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
location, and to steal his claim before he could
stake it himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still, feeling certain of that in your
own mind, you paid him his price!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Every dollar of it&mdash;before I took the midnight
train West. I raised it after business
hours, in a dozen different ways; but I got
it. I pooled for security everything I had in
the world&mdash;except Old Reliable; I kept that
free for a purpose,&mdash;my house, my library, my
stock in the traction company, some real estate
I own. I had to give good measure because I
had to have the money right then. And I got
it. It was a pull but I got it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl&#8217;s head was back on her folded arms
once more, the long lashes all but covering her
eyes.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Supposing Evans had been lying to you
after all,&#8221; she suggested, &#8220;in other things besides
the one you mentioned.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Over Roberts&#8217; face flashed a momentary smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I told you we were locked in that room together
for an hour. He wasn&#8217;t lying to me after
that time had passed, rest assured. Besides, I
wasn&#8217;t entirely helpless or surprised. I&#8217;d been
out in that country myself and Evans wasn&#8217;t
the only man I had reporting. I&#8217;d been waiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
for a chance of this kind from the day the
first prospect developed at Goldfield. I knew
it would come sometime&mdash;if I waited my
chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So you gambled&mdash;with every cent you had
in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. All life is a gamble. If I had lost
I was only thirty-five and the earth is big.
Besides, to all the world I was still &#8216;old man&#8217;
Roberts, not &#8216;Darley.&#8217; There was yet plenty
of time&mdash;if I lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You went West that same evening, you
say.&#8221; The long lashes were all but touching
now. &#8220;What then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, with Evans in the same Pullman section
and Old Reliable in the express car forward.
I had an idea in my head and followed
it out. I felt as certain as I was of my own
name that they&#8217;d have scouts out to wire ahead
when Evans was coming; so it wouldn&#8217;t be
any use to get off at an obscure place. I also
knew that the chances were I couldn&#8217;t get a
conveyance there at once for love or money; so
Old Reliable was already&mdash;good and ready.
Every tank was full. The tonneau was packed:
ten gallons extra gas, five gallons of water, a
week&#8217;s rations&mdash;everything I could think of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
that we might need. We&#8217;d go through to the
end of the line, all right, but if I could help
it we shouldn&#8217;t wait long after we got there.
And we didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time the girl did not interrupt, either
with comment or gesture; merely lay there
listening.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Ten minutes after we struck town we were
away, under our own power. It was night, but
we were away just the same. And that&#8217;s where
we got the lead,&mdash;a half hour&#8217;s lead. They
knew, all right, that we&#8217;d come, fancied they
knew everything&mdash;but they hadn&#8217;t planned on
Old Reliable. It took them just that long to
come to and make readjustment. Then the real
fun began. There was no moon, and out on
the desert the night was as dark as a pocket.
We simply had to have a light even if it gave
us away. Evans thought he knew the road; but,
if there ever was one, before we&#8217;d gone ten
miles we&#8217;d lost it. After that I drove by compass
entirely&mdash;and instinct. But I couldn&#8217;t go
fast. I didn&#8217;t dare to. For an hour and a half&mdash;the
indicator showed we&#8217;d gone twenty-four
miles&mdash;we had everything to ourselves, seemingly
the entire world. We hadn&#8217;t heard a
sound or seen a live thing. Then, as we came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
up on a rise, Evans looked back and saw a light,&mdash;just
one light, away, away back like a star.
A few seconds afterward it disappeared and we
made a couple more miles. We mounted a
second rise and&mdash;this time Evans swore. He
was with me by this time, body and soul, game
to the finish; for the light wasn&#8217;t starlike now
by any means. It didn&#8217;t even twinkle. It just
simply rose up out of the ground, shone steady,
vanished for a time, and rose up anew with the
lay of the country. They were on our trail at
last, they couldn&#8217;t miss it. It was plain as a
wagon road, and they were making two miles
to our one. They must have had a good car;
but anyway everything was with them. They
could drive to the limit by our trail; but I
couldn&#8217;t, for I didn&#8217;t know what was ahead.
I let her out, though, and Evans watched. He
didn&#8217;t swear now, he just watched; and every
time that light showed it was nearer. At last,&mdash;we&#8217;d
made thirty-two miles by that time,&mdash;he
saw two lights behind instead of one&mdash;and
saw them red, I judge, for how he swore! It
was then or never and I opened the throttle
to the last notch and we flew over everything,
through everything until&mdash;we stopped.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You struck something?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t know what nor didn&#8217;t stop
to see. The transmission went, I knew that.
The engine was still threshing and pounding
when we took to our heels. We could hear it
and see the two lights coming and we ran&mdash;Lord,
how we ran! It seems humorous now,
but it wasn&#8217;t humorous then. There was a
fortune at stake and a big one; for a claim belongs
to the chap who puts up the monuments.
We ran straight ahead into the night, until we
couldn&#8217;t run another foot; and then we walked,
walked, ten miles if an inch, until the two lights
of Old Reliable became one, and then went out
of sight entirely. Then we lay down and panted
and waited for daylight.... That&#8217;s about all,
I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They didn&#8217;t follow you, then?&#8221; The girl
was sitting up now, the brown eyes wide
open.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t. A hound might have done
so, but a human being couldn&#8217;t that night.&#8221;
Roberts dropped back to the grass, again avoiding
the rift of light. &#8220;At daylight Evans got
his bearings, and that day we found the claim,
built our monuments, tacked up the notice and
the rest. I learned afterwards there were six
men in the machine behind; but I never saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
any of them&mdash;until the day I left. They made
me an offer then.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And Old Reliable?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts hesitated, then he laughed oddly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I paid a parting visit there too. The remains
weren&#8217;t decent junk when the same six
got through expressing their feelings that
night.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>FULFILMENT</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An hour had passed. As the afternoon sun
sank lower the shadow blot beneath the big
maple had lengthened and deepened. In consequence
the annoying light-rift was no more.
Overhead the leaves were vibrating, barely vibrating,
with the first breath of breeze of evening
born. Otherwise there was no change; just
the big red roadster and the man and the girl
idling beside.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Poverty, work, subservience,&#8221; conversation
had drifted where it would, at last had temporarily
halted, with the calendar rolled back
twenty years; &#8220;poverty, work, subservience,&#8221;
the man had paused there to laugh, the odd,
repressed laugh that added an emphasis no
mere words could express. &#8220;Yes; they&#8217;re old
friends of mine, very old friends, very. I&#8217;m
not likely to forget the contrast they&#8217;ve made,
ever, no matter what the future holds.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve not forgotten, then, what&#8217;s past,&mdash;overlooked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
it? Isn&#8217;t it better to forget, sometimes,&mdash;some
things?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Forget?&#8221; The man was looking straight
up into space. &#8220;I wish I could forget, wish it
from the bottom of my soul. It makes me&mdash;hard
at times, and I don&#8217;t want to be hard.
But I can&#8217;t ever. Memory is branded in too
deeply.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl was picking a blade of grass to
pieces, bit by bit.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed. I fancied you could do
anything you wished,&#8221; she said low. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what has made me afraid of you sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man did not stir.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Are you afraid of me sometimes, really?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, horribly&mdash;as much afraid as when we
were coming out here to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Elice, sorry for several reasons.
Most of all because I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the first word of the kind that had
ever passed between them. Yet neither showed
surprise, nor did either change position. It was
as though he had said that gravitation makes
the apple fall, or that the earth was round, a
thing they had both known for long, had become
instinctively adjusted to.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I knew that,&#8221; said the girl gently, &#8220;and
know too that you&#8217;re sorry I am afraid. You
can&#8217;t help it. If it weren&#8217;t true, though, you
wouldn&#8217;t be you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man looked at her gravely.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You think it will always be that way?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;You&#8217;ll always be afraid at times, I
mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. You&#8217;re bigger than I am. I can&#8217;t
understand you, I never can wholly. I&#8217;ve given
up hope. We&#8217;re all afraid of things we can&#8217;t
completely understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Silently the man passed his hand across his
face, unconsciously; his arm fell lax at his side.
As the girl had known, he did not follow the
lead, would not follow it unless she directed the
way.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You said you fancied I could forget what&#8217;s
past,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Did you honestly believe
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, or ignore it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Ignore it&mdash;or forget!&#8221; The fingers of the
great hands twitched. &#8220;Some things one can&#8217;t
ignore or forget, girl. To do so would be superhuman.
You don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; you&#8217;ve never told me. You&#8217;ve suggested
at times, merely suggested; nothing more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;d like to know why&mdash;the reason? It
would help you to understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I think it would help.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It might even lead to making you&mdash;unafraid?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A halt this time, then, &#8220;Yes, it might possibly
do even that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the man looked at her for long in
silence, and again very gravely.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
pleasant for me to tell nor for you to hear;
but I&#8217;d like you to know why&mdash;if you can.
They&#8217;re all back, back, the things I&#8217;d like to
forget and can&#8217;t, a very long way. They date
from the time I first knew anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl settled deeper into the soft coat, her
eyes half closed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You told me once you couldn&#8217;t remember
your mother even,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, nor my father, nor any other relatives,
if I ever had any. I was simply stranded in
Kansas City when it was new. I wasn&#8217;t born
there, though, but out West on a prairie ranch
somewhere. The tradition is that my parents
were hand-to-mouth theatrical people, who&#8217;d got
the free home craze and tried to live out on the
west Kansas desert, who were dried out and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
starved out until they went back on the road;
and who then, of course, didn&#8217;t want me. I
don&#8217;t know. Anyway, when my brain awoke
I was there in Kansas City. As a youngster I
had a dozen homes&mdash;and none. I was any one&#8217;s
property&mdash;and no one&#8217;s. I did anything, accepted
whatever Providence offered, to eat. Animals
must live and I was no exception. The
hand seemingly of every man and woman in the
world was against me, and I conformed to the
inevitable. Any one weaker than I was my
prey, any one stronger my enemy. I learned
to fight for my own, to run when it was wisest,
to take hard knocks when I couldn&#8217;t avoid them&mdash;and
say nothing. It was all in the game. I
know this isn&#8217;t pleasant to hear,&#8221; he digressed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m listening. Go on, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That was the first stage. Then, together
with a hundred other similar little beasts, a
charitable organization got hold of me and
transplanted me out into the country, as they
do old footsore hack horses when they get to
cluttering the pavement. Chance ordained that
I should draw an old Norwegian farmer, the
first generation over, and that he should draw
me. I fancy we were equally pleased. His
contract was to feed me and clothe me and,&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
was twelve at the time, by the way,&mdash;to get out
of me in return what work he could. There
was no written contract, of course; but nevertheless
it was understood just the same.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He fulfilled his obligation&mdash;in his way.
He was the first generation over, I repeat, and
had no more sense of humor than a turtle. He
saw that I had all I could eat&mdash;after I&#8217;d done
precisely so much work, his own arbitrary stint,
and not a minute before. If I was one iota
short I went hungry as an object-lesson. He
gave me clothes to wear, after every other member
of the family had discarded them, in supreme
disregard for suitability or fit. He sent me to
school&mdash;during the months of January and
February, when there was absolutely nothing
else to do, and when I should have been in the
way at home. At times of controversy he was
mighty with the rod. He was, particularly at
the beginning of our intimacy, several sizes
larger than I. It was all a very pleasant arrangement,
and lasted four years. It ended
abruptly one Thanksgiving Day.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I remember that day distinctly, as much
so as yesterday. Notwithstanding it was a holiday,
I&#8217;d been husking corn all day steady, from
dark until dark. There was snow on the ground,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
and I came in wet through, chattering cold,
hungry, and dog-tired&mdash;to find the entire family
had left to celebrate the evening with a
neighbor. They did that often of a holiday,
but usually they left word. This time they&#8217;d
forgotten, or didn&#8217;t care. Anyway, it didn&#8217;t
matter, for that day had been the last straw.
So far as I was concerned the clock had struck
twelve and a new circuit had begun.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I looked about the kitchen for supper, but
there was none, so I proceeded to prepare one
suitable to the occasion. Among other things,
the farmer raised turkeys for the market and,
although the season was late, there were a few
birds left for seed. I went out to the barn with
a lantern and picked the plumpest gobbler I
could find off the roost, and an hour later had
him in the oven. This was at eight o&#8217;clock in
the evening. While he was baking I canvassed
the old farmer&#8217;s wardrobe. I&#8217;d grown like a
mushroom those last years and, though I was
only sixteen, a suit of his ready-made clothes
was a fair fit. I got into it grimly. I also
found a dog-skin fur coat and, while it smelled
a good deal like its original owner, it would be
warm, and I laid it aside carefully for future
reference.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Then came supper. I didn&#8217;t hurry in the
least, but I had a campaign in mind, so I went
to work. When that bird was done I ate it, and
everything else I could find. I had the appetite
of an ostrich, and when I was through there
wasn&#8217;t enough left for a hungry cat. I even
considered taking the family cat in to the feast,&mdash;they
had one, of course, and it always looked
hungry, too; but I had a sort of pride in my
achievement and I wanted to leave the remains
as evidence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It was ten o&#8217;clock by this time and no one
had shown up. I was positively sorry. I&#8217;d
hoped the old farmer would return and find me.
I had a few last words to say to him, some that
had been lying heavy on my mind for a long
time. But he didn&#8217;t come, and I couldn&#8217;t wait
any longer; so I wrote them instead. I put
on the dog-skin coat and started away on foot
into the night. If I&#8217;d had money I would have
left the value of the clothes; but he&#8217;d never
given me a dollar in all those four years, so I
took them on account. It was two miles to town
and I made it in time to catch the ten-forty-five
freight out.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I forgot one thing, though. I went back
after I&#8217;d got started a quarter of a mile to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
good-bye to the horses. I always liked horses,
and old Bill and Jerry and I had been good
friends. I rode the pilot of that engine and got
into Kansas City the next morning. That was
the second stage.... Still interested, are you,
Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Next, I landed in the hardwood region of
Missouri, the north edge of the Ozarks. It was
the old story of one having to live, and I&#8217;d seen
an ad in the papers for &#8216;loggers wanted.&#8217; I
had answered it, and the man in charge dropped
on me like a hawk and gave me transportation
by the first train. Evidently men for the job
were not in excess, and when I&#8217;d been there a
day I knew why. It was the most God-forsaken
country I&#8217;d ever known, away back in the mountains,
where civilization had ceased advancing
fifty years before. The job was a contract to
deliver so many thousand feet of lumber in the
log daily at the mill on the nearest railway.
There was a five-mile haul, and we worked under
a boss in crews of four. Each crew had to deliver
eight big logs a day, seven days in the
week, three hundred and sixty-five days in the
year. How it was done, when they were cut,
when hauled, was not the boss&#8217;s affair&mdash;just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
so the logs came. When we of the crews ate
or slept was no one&#8217;s affair&mdash;just so we kept
on the job. No single man could handle one
of those big cuts, no single mule team haul it
in places over those cursed mountain roads.
That&#8217;s why we worked in crews. On the average
we worked eighteen hours a day. In summer
this was long, in winter it seemed perpetual;
but I was in it and I was going to stick&mdash;or
thought I was. The other three in my
gang were middle-aged men,&mdash;hard drinkers,
good swearers, tough as oak themselves. The
boss was a little tobacco-eating, bow-legged Irishman.
I never, before or since, knew a man who
could swear as he could, or drink so when he
struck town. It seems to go with the logging
business; but he was a master.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I struck this place in the winter. It was in
the winter following, again by chance on a
holiday, but Christmas this time, that I quit.
They don&#8217;t have much cold down in that country
and usually but little snow; but this year
there had been a lot,&mdash;soft, wet snow, half rain,
that melted on the ground and made the roads
almost impassable. For that reason we&#8217;d been
getting behind in our contract. We simply
could not make two trips a day; and Murphy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
the boss, grew black and blacker. He swore
that if we couldn&#8217;t make but one trip a day on
that one haul we&#8217;d have to carry two logs each
instead of one. The thing was barely possible
on good roads, wholly impossible with the
ground softened; but he was the boss, his word
law, and before daylight on this Christmas
morning we were loaded and on the road.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was on the head wagon with Murphy
behind me, the other three following. The first
half-mile was down grade and we got along all
right. Then came the inevitable up grade following
and the team began to flounder. They
were mules, of course,&mdash;horses could never have
stood for a day the grief of that mountain
hauling,&mdash;great big-framed, willing fellows that
in condition would pull anything any team
could pull; but now they were weak and tired,
and so thin that their bones almost stuck through
their hides from the endless grind. They did
their best, though, and struggled along for a
few rods. The wheels struck a rock in the
road and they stopped. I urged them on and
they tried again, but the load wouldn&#8217;t budge.
There was but one thing to do,&mdash;to double with
the team behind, and I slid off to make the
coupling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Murphy had been watching it all in silence,&mdash;a
bad sign with him. When he saw what
I was going to do he held up his hand to the
rear team, which meant:&#8216;Stay where you are.&#8217;
&#8216;Give over the lines,&#8217; he said to me.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I knew what that meant. I&#8217;d seen him
cripple animals before; but that was when I
first came. Since then I&#8217;d had another year
to grow and to get hard and tough. I was
going on eighteen and as big as I am now almost;
and I wasn&#8217;t afraid of him then or of
any human being alive.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s no use,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;We may as
well double and save time.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He said something then, no matter what;
I was used to being sworn at.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; I said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He jumped off the load at that. I thought
it was between us, so I jerked off my big mittens
to be ready; but the mules&#8217; turn was
to come first, it seems. He didn&#8217;t wait for
anything, just simply went at them, like a
maniac, like a demon. I won&#8217;t tell you about
it&mdash;it was too horribly brutal&mdash;or about what
followed. I simply saw red. For the first time
and the last time in my life, I hope, I fought
a man&mdash;fought like a beast, tooth and nail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
When it was over he was lying there in the mud
we&#8217;d made, unconscious; and I was looking
down at him and gasping for breath. I was
bleeding in a dozen places, for he had a knife;
but I never noticed. I suppose I stood there
so for a minute looking at him, the other three
men who had come up looking at me, and not
one of us saying a word. I reached over and
felt of him from head to foot. There were no
bones broken and he was breathing steadily. So
I did what I suppose was a cruel thing, but one
I&#8217;ve never regretted to this day, though I&#8217;ve
never seen him since. I simply rolled him over
and over in the mud and slush out of the road&mdash;and
left him to come to. After that we
pulled off the second log from each of the four
wagons and left them there beside the track.
Then we drove on to town, leaving him there;
sitting up by that time, still dazed, by the
side of the road. There was just one logging
train a day on that stub, and when we pulled
into town it was waiting. Without a word
of understanding, or our pay for the month,
the four of us took that train and went our
four separate ways. That&#8217;s the third stage....
Begin to understand a little, do you,
Elice?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; I begin, just begin, to understand&mdash;many
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts shifted position silently, his arms
crossed under his head for a pillow. But he
was still looking straight up, through the gently
rocking leaves at the infinite beyond.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The next stage found me in a southern Iowa
soft-coal mine. The explanation is simple. I
had saved a few dollars; while they lasted I
drifted, and to the north. When they were
gone I had to work or starve. I had no education
whatever, no special training even. I was
merely a big, healthy animal, fit only for hard,
physical work. I happened to be in a farming
and mining community. It was Winter and
there was nothing to do on a farm, so by the
law of necessity I went to work heaving coal.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I stayed there a little over seven months
and during that time I scarcely saw the sun.
I&#8217;d go into the tunnel at seven in the morning,
take my lunch with me, and never come out
until quitting time. I worked seven days in
the week here too. There wasn&#8217;t any union and,
anyway, no one seemed to think of doing differently.
At first it used to worry me, that
being always in the dark. My imagination kept
working, picturing sunlight and green things;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
after a bit that stage passed and I used to
dread to come out of the tunnel. The glare
hurt my eyes and made me blink like an owl
in the daytime. I felt chilly, too, and shivered
so my teeth chattered. But I stuck to it, and
after a few months the thing seemed natural
and almost as though I&#8217;d been there always.
I began to cease to think and to work unconsciously,
like a piece of machinery. I even quit
counting the days. They were all the same, so
what was the use? I just worked, worked, and
the coal dust ground into me and sweated into
me until I looked more like a negro than a white
man.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Time drifted on this way, from Winter
until Spring, from Spring until Summer; at
last the something unusual that always comes
about sooner or later happened, and I awoke.
It was just after dinner one day and I&#8217;d gone
back to the job. I had a lot of loose coal
knocked down in the drift and was shovelling
steadily into a car when, away down the main
tunnel, I saw a bunch of lights bobbing in the
darkness. It wasn&#8217;t the time of day for an
inspection, and anyway there were several
people approaching, so I waited to see what
it meant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They came on slowly, stopping to look at
everything by the way. At last they got near
enough so I could make them out; there were
three men and a woman. I recognized one of
the men by this time,&mdash;our foreman, Sharp.
He was guiding the others and I knew then
they were visitors, owners probably, because no
stranger had ever come before while I was there.
The woman, I saw that she was a girl now,
called one of the men &#8216;father&#8217;; and from the
way she spoke I guessed why she was along
too. She&#8217;d come anyway, whether they approved
or not. The drift I was working in was
a new one, just opened; and when they got
there the whole group stopped a little way off,
and Sharp began explaining, talking fast and
giving figures. If any of the men saw me they
didn&#8217;t pay any attention; they just listened,
and now and then one of them asked a question.
But the girl wasn&#8217;t interested or listening.
She was all eyes, looking about here and
there, taking in everything; and after a bit she
noticed the light in my cap and came peering
over to see what it meant. I just stood there
watching her and she came quite close, all curiosity,
until finally she could see my face. She
stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I thought it was just a
light. It&#8217;s a man.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Yes, it&#8217;s a man,&#8217; I said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She was looking at me steadily by this time,
wholly curious.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;A&mdash;a white man?&#8217; she asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I thought a moment, then I understood.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Yes, a white man,&#8217; I answered.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She came up to the car at that and looked
in. She glanced back at me. Evidently she
wasn&#8217;t entirely satisfied.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;How old are you?&#8217; she asked. &#8216;You look
awfully old.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I leaned over on the car too; I&#8217;d begun to
think. I remembered that to me she seemed so
very, very young; and all at once it flashed over
me that probably I wasn&#8217;t a day older.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Eighteen,&#8217; I said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Eighteen!&#8217; She stared. &#8216;Why, I&#8217;m eighteen.
And you&mdash;have you been here long?&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose I smiled. Anyway I know I
scared her. She drew back.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; I said. &#8216;I&#8217;ve forgotten.
If you&#8217;ll tell me the date maybe I can answer.
I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;You don&#8217;t know! You can&#8217;t mean that.&#8217;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Yes, I&#8217;ve forgotten.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t say a word after that, just looked
at me&mdash;as a youngster looks when it goes to
the circus for the first time. I fancy we stood
there half a minute so; then at last, interrupting,
the man she&#8217;d called &#8216;father&#8217; looked over
and saw us. He frowned, I could see that, and
said something to the foreman. He spoke her
name.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Just for a moment Roberts shifted his head,
looking at his silent listener steadily. &#8220;What
do you fancy was that name he called, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason started involuntarily, and settled
back in her place.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t an ordinary name. At that time
I&#8217;d never heard it before.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not good at guessing.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts shifted back to his old position.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It was &#8216;Elice.&#8217; &#8216;Elice, come,&#8217; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The daughter hesitated. I imagine she
wanted to ask me several things yet,&mdash;whether
I had cloven feet, for instance, and lived on
spiders; but she didn&#8217;t. She went back to the
other three and they moved on. That was the
last I saw of them.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I worked the rest of that day, did about
three men&#8217;s work, I remember. That night I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
drew my pay and went to bed; but I didn&#8217;t
go to sleep. I did a lot of thinking and made
up my mind to something. I decided I&#8217;d been
the under dog long enough. I haven&#8217;t changed
the opinion since. Next day I saw the sun
when it was straight overhead and soaked the
coal dust out of my skin&mdash;as much as possible....
That&#8217;s all of the fourth stage....
Hadn&#8217;t I better stop?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl shook her head, but still without looking
at him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I want to learn what you did after
that, after you woke up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I went West. I hadn&#8217;t seen the sun or the
sky for so long that I was hungry for it. In
Omaha I fell in with a bunch of cattlemen and,
as I always liked to handle stock, that settled
it. I accepted an offer as herder; they didn&#8217;t
call it that, but it amounted to the same. I had
a half-dozen ponies, rations for six months, and
something under a thousand head of stock to
look after. By comparison it wasn&#8217;t work at
all; only I was all alone and it took all the
time, day and night. I didn&#8217;t sleep under a
roof half a dozen nights from July to October.
When the cattle bunched at night I simply
rolled up in a blanket where they were and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
watched the stars until I forgot them; the next
thing I knew it was morning. I had hours to
read in though, hours and hours; and that was
another thing I was after. For I could read,
I wasn&#8217;t quite illiterate, and I was dead in
earnest at last. When the Fall round-up came
I quit and went to Denver, and portered in a
big hotel and went to night school.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much to tell after this. I drifted
all over the West and the Southwest during the
next few years. I got the mining fever and
prospected in Colorado and California and Arizona;
but I never struck anything. I learned
something though; and that was that it isn&#8217;t
the fellow who makes a find who wins, but the
chap who buys the prospect, almost invariably.
That was useful. Every Winter I landed in a
big city and went to school,&mdash;night school or
mining school or commercial school. Finally it
dawned upon me that I was taking the long
road to an end, that the short cut was to be
really ready to do a thing before making the
attempt. I decided to go to a university. That
would take years, and meantime I had to live.
I could make a living in a little city easier than
a big one, so I came here.... You know the
rest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason sat up, her fingers locked over
her knees.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know the rest; but&mdash;&#8221; She was
silent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But you don&#8217;t wholly understand,&#8221; completed
the other. &#8220;You don&#8217;t, even yet, do you,
Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not entirely, even yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Why I can&#8217;t forget when I wish or help
being hard?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, when you have such infinite possibilities
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Now,&#8221; supplemented the man evenly, &#8220;when
society at large couldn&#8217;t pound me down any
longer or prevent my getting out of their
power.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl did not answer.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Deliberately Roberts sat up; no longer listless
or tolerantly self-analytic, but very wide
awake, very direct.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to tell you a few more reasons,
then; read between the lines a bit. I never did
this before to any one; never will again&mdash;to
any one. But I must make you understand
what made me as I am. I must; you know
why. Tell me to stop when you wish, I&#8217;ll obey
gladly; but don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t understand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;To begin again at the beginning. My parents
abandoned me. Why? They were starved
to it, forced to it. Self-preservation is the first
law. I don&#8217;t clear them, but I understand.
They were starving and irresponsible. I merely
paid the price of relief, the price society at large
demanded.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;At the first home I had afterward the man
drank,&mdash;drank to forget that he, too, was an
under dog. Some one again must pay the
price, and I paid it. Now and then I&#8217;d succeed
in selling a few papers, or do an errand,
and earn a few pennies. After the manner of
all lesser animals I&#8217;d try to hide with them; but
he&#8217;d find me every time. He seemed to have
a genius for it. He&#8217;d whip me with whatever
was handy; at first for trying to hide, later,
when I wouldn&#8217;t cry, because I was stubborn.
Finally, after he&#8217;d got tired or satisfied, he&#8217;d
steal my coppers and head for the nearest bar.
Once in January I remember a lady I met on
the street took me into a store and bought me
a new pair of shoes. I hid them successfully
for a week. One day he caught me with them
on&mdash;and pawned them.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The old farmer the charity folks traded me
to was a Lutheran. Every morning after breakfast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
he read prayers. He never missed a day.
Then he&#8217;d send me out with one of his sons,&mdash;a
grown-up man of twenty-two,&mdash;and if I
didn&#8217;t do exactly as much work as the son I
went hungry until I got it done if it took half
the night. He also had a willow sapling he relied
upon when hunger didn&#8217;t prove effective.
He&#8217;d pray before he used that too,&mdash;pray with
one hand gripping my neckband so I couldn&#8217;t
get away. I earned a dollar a day&mdash;one single
solitary dollar&mdash;when I was logging oak in the
Ozarks. Day after day when we were on the
haul I used to strap myself fast to the load to
keep from going to sleep and rolling off under
the wheels. I got so dead tired that I fell asleep
walking, when I did that to keep awake. You
won&#8217;t believe it, but it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve done it
more than once.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was sick one day in the coal mine, deathly
sick. The air at times was awful. I laid down
just outside the car track. I thought I was
going to die and felt distinctly pleased at the
prospect. Some one reported me to the superintendent.
He evidently knew the symptoms,
for he came with a pail of water and soaked
me where I lay, marked time, and went away.
I laid there for three hours in a puddle of water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
and soft coal grime; then I went back to work.
I know it was three hours because my time check
was docked exactly that much.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;When I was going to night school in Denver
the day clerk, who&#8217;d got me the place, took
half my tips, the only pay I received, to permit
me to hold the place. It was the rule, I discovered,
the under-dog penalty.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I said I never struck anything prospecting.
I did. I struck a silver lead down in Arizona.
While I was proving it a couple of other prospectors
came along, dead broke&mdash;and out of
provisions. I divided food with them, of course&mdash;it&#8217;s
the unwritten law&mdash;and they camped
for the night. We had supper together. That
was the last I knew. When I came to it was
thirty-six hours later and I was a hundred miles
away in a cheap hotel&mdash;without even my bill
paid in advance. The record showed that claim
was filed on the day I disappeared. The mine
is paying a hundred dollars a day now. I never
saw those two prospectors again. The present
owner bought of them square. I don&#8217;t hold it
up against him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I went to night school all one winter in San
Francisco with a fellow named Stuart, another
under dog like myself. We roomed together in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
a hall-bedroom to save expense and ate fifteen-cent
dinners together at the same soup-house.
He clerked in a little tobacco store daytimes. I
was running an express elevator. We both
saved a little money above what it cost to live.
Things went on in this way for four months,
until the end of the winter term. One morning
when I woke up I found he&#8217;d gone. I also
found that the little money I&#8217;d saved was gone.
They went together. I never saw either again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I had another friend once, I thought. It
was after I&#8217;d decided to come here to the university.
I was harvesting on a wheat ranch in
Nebraska, making money to pay for my matriculation.
He was a student too, he said, from
New York State, and working for the same purpose.
We worked there together all through
harvest, boiled side by side in the same sun.
One day he announced a telegram from home.
His mother was dying. He was crazy almost
because he hadn&#8217;t nearly enough money to take
him back at once. And there his mother was
in New York State dying! I lent him all I
had saved,&mdash;seventy odd dollars; and he gave
me his note, insisted on doing so&mdash;though he
hoped the Lord would strike him dead if he
failed to return the loan within four days. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
have that note yet. Perhaps the Lord did strike
him dead. I don&#8217;t know.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It was nearly September by this time and
harvest was over, my job with it, of course; so
I started on east afoot, tramping it. I wasn&#8217;t
a particularly handsome specimen, but still I
was clean, and I never asked for a meal without
offering to work for it. Yet in the three
hundred miles I covered before school opened
I had four farmers&#8217; wives call the dog,&mdash;I recorded
the number; and I only slept under a
roof two nights.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Even after I came here, after&mdash;Elice,
don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m a brute to have done this! From
the bottom of my soul I beg your pardon.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl was weeping repressedly, her face
buried in her hands, her whole body tense.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice, please don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m ashamed. I only
wanted you to understand; and now&mdash;I&#8217;m
simply ashamed.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be at all.&#8221; As suddenly as it
had come the storm abated, under compulsion.
&#8220;I wanted to know several things very much;
and now I think I do know them. At least I
don&#8217;t wonder any more&mdash;why.&#8221; She stood up
decisively, disdaining to dry her eyes.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But we mustn&#8217;t stop to chatter any more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
now,&#8221; she digressed preventingly. &#8220;You made
me forget all about time, and cooks should never
forget that. It&#8217;s nearly sundown and father&mdash;he&#8217;ll
have been hungry for two hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts got to his feet slowly. If in the new
light of understanding there was more he had
intended saying that day, or if at the sudden
barring of opportunity he felt disappointment,
his face gave no indication of the fact. He
merely smiled in tolerant appreciation of the
suggestion last made.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your father know the remedy for
hunger yet, at his age?&#8221; he queried whimsically.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Knows it, yes,&#8221; with an odd laugh; &#8220;but
it would never occur to him unless some one
else suggested it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A pause, then she looked her companion full
in the face, significantly so. &#8220;He&#8217;s dependent
and irresponsible as a child or&mdash;as Steve Armstrong.
They&#8217;re helpless both, absolutely, left
to themselves; and speaking of that, they&#8217;re
both by themselves now.&#8221; She started for the
motor hastily, again significantly so.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Come, please,&#8221; she requested.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CRISIS</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was nearly dark when the big red car drew
up in front of the Gleason cottage and, the
girl only alighting, moved on again slowly down
the street. At the second crossing beyond, out
of sight of the house, it switched abruptly to
the right for four blocks, into the poorer section
of the town, and stopped before a battered, old-fashioned
residence. A middle-aged man in his
shirt sleeves sat on the step smoking a pipe.
At a nod from the driver he advanced to the
curb.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Mr. Armstrong in, Edwards?&#8221; asked Roberts
directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man shook his head.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Been here, has he?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not since he left this morning; about ten
o&#8217;clock it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts paused, his hand on the clutch lever.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Will you have him &#8217;phone me when he comes,
please?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, certainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The next stop was at the office, dark with a
Sabbath darkness; but not for long. Within
the space of a few minutes after he came, every
light switched on, the windows open wide, his
coat dangling from a chair in the corner, Roberts
was at work upon a small mountain of correspondence
collected upon his desk, a mountain
of which each unit was marked &#8220;personal&#8221; or
&#8220;private.&#8221; At almost the same time a waiter
from a near-by <i>café</i> entered with a tray of sandwiches
and coffee. Thereafter he ate as he
worked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An hour passed. The sandwiches disappeared
entirely and the mountain grew slightly smaller.
A second hour dragged by and the mountain
suffered a second decline. For the first time
Roberts halted and glanced at the clock. A
moment later he took down the receiver from
the &#8217;phone on his desk and gave a number.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That you, Randall? Has Armstrong been
at your place to-night? You haven&#8217;t seen him
at all to-day, then. No; nothing. Just wanted
to know, that was all. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Another half-hour passed; then, without pausing
in his work, Roberts pulled the buzzer lever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
for a messenger. When the latter appeared he
scribbled a few lines on a sheet of paper, addressed
an envelope, and gave it to the boy with
half a dollar.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;There&#8217;s a mate to that coin waiting here
for you if you can get me an answer within
half an hour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know the party,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sure. Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Follow up the trail, then. You&#8217;ve lost one
minute of your thirty already.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the third time he returned to his work,
halting only when the messenger in blue
returned.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Can&#8217;t deliver it, sir,&#8221; explained the latter
curtly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been all over town and no one
has seen him. Thank you, sir. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For several minutes this time Darley Roberts
sat in his desk chair thinking, quite motionless.
The clock on the wall recorded midnight and
he compared the time with his watch to make
certain of its accuracy. Once more he took
down the telephone receiver.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;This you, Elice?&#8221; he asked after a moment.
&#8220;Can I be of service? Never mind, no need to
explain. I understand. I&#8217;ll be right up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In spite of the city speed limit the big red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
car made those twelve blocks intervening in
sixty-four seconds flat.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How did you ever know?&#8221;&mdash;infinite wonder,
infinite relief as well in the tone. &#8220;Tell
me that, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, of course. I merely guessed.
Has it been long?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Involuntarily the girl shuddered, then held
herself steady with an effort.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, since dinner. He came while we were
eating; and father&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understand,&#8221; preventingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.
It&#8217;s all over with now. Did any one else see&mdash;any
of the neighbors, I mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think not. It was after dark and&mdash;Oh,
it&#8217;s simply horrible! horrible!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; gently. &#8220;I appreciate that. Let&#8217;s not
speak about it. Your two roomers are both in?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl nodded.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;They didn&#8217;t suspect anything wrong either?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, the hammock was dark&mdash;and father
watched. They went right up to their rooms
without stopping.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts nodded, and looked out of the window.
The light in the residence district of the
town was on a midnight schedule and was now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
cut off. He turned back. A moment he stood
so, silent, facing the girl there in the dimly lighted
hall. Under a sudden instinct he reached out
and laid a hand compellingly on each of her
shoulders, holding her captive.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You don&#8217;t misunderstand my intruding here
to-night, do you, Elice?&#8221; he asked directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Misunderstand!&#8221; The girl looked at him
steadily, the dark circles about her eyes eloquent.
&#8220;Never. How can you fancy such a thing!
Never.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you&#8217;re willing to trust me to bring
everything out right? It will be all right, take
my word for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still the girl did not stir, but gazed at him.
&#8220;Yes, I trust you implicitly, always,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment longer the hands held their place
before they dropped.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; he said perfunctorily, &#8220;go
to bed. I&#8217;ll take care of Steve&mdash;to-night and
in the future. Don&#8217;t worry. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wait,&#8221; a hand was upon his arm, a compelling
hand. &#8220;You mean&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts smiled deliberately, his slow, impersonal
smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Exactly what I said. This will be a lesson
Steve should never forget. I can&#8217;t imagine his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
repeating it&mdash;ever. Besides, I&#8217;ll help him not
to. I have a plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean to help him as&mdash;as you helped
Harry Randall and Margery?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment the man was silent, though he
smiled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not exactly. I&#8217;ll merely assist him to
help himself. I think perhaps it&#8217;s only my duty
anyway, that maybe I&#8217;m more or less responsible.
By the way, don&#8217;t be surprised if he disappears
for a bit. He may possibly decide to
go out of town. That&#8217;s all, for now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl drew a long breath.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You responsible!&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;If you&#8217;re
responsible, how, then, about&mdash;myself?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice!&#8221; Roberts cut her off peremptorily.
&#8220;I refuse to listen. Go to bed at once, I insist.
I&#8217;ll come to-morrow and talk if you wish.
Just now it&#8217;s all too near. Good-night again.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant later, on the darkened porch without,
he had the arm of the doddering old man
in the grip of a vise.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Leave everything here to me,&#8221; he said
swiftly, &#8220;and see to Elice.&#8221; He was leading
the other toward the entrance. &#8220;Listen. See
that she goes to bed&mdash;at once; and you too.
I&#8217;ll attend to everything else. Trust me,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
very gently he himself closed the door behind
the other two.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was after office hours of the day following
when Stephen Armstrong, a bit pale but carefully
groomed this time, entered the outer room
of Darley Roberts&#8217; office and, with decided reluctance,
approached the private apartment
beyond. The door was open. Seated before
the big desk, shirt-sleeved as usual, Roberts
sat working. As the newcomer approached he
wheeled about.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to
see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The visitor took a seat by the open window
and looked out rather obviously.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I just received your note a bit ago,&#8221; he
began perfunctorily, &#8220;and called instead of giving
you an appointment, as you asked. It&#8217;s
the least I could do after last night.&#8221; He
halted, looking at the building opposite steadily.
&#8220;I want you to know that I appreciate thoroughly
what you did for me then. I&mdash;I&#8217;m
heartily ashamed, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of it, please,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
forgotten it and I&#8217;m sure Miss Gleason and her
father have done the same. No one else knows,
so let&#8217;s consider it never occurred. It never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
will again, I&#8217;m sure, so what&#8217;s the use of remembering?
Is it agreed?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong&#8217;s narrow shoulders lifted in silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As for not speaking of it again,&#8221; he answered
after a moment, &#8220;yes. Whether or not
in the future, however&mdash;I&#8217;m not liar enough
to promise things I can&#8217;t deliver.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But you can &#8216;deliver,&#8217; as you say,&#8221; shortly.
&#8220;You know it yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong shook his head.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not as bumptious as I was a few years
ago,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;I&#8217;d have said &#8216;yes&#8217;
then undoubtedly. Now&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts swung about in his desk chair, the
crease between his eyes suddenly grown deep.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; he refuted curtly. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
the first man in the world who has done something
to regret. Every one has in some way
or another&mdash;and profited by the experience.
It&#8217;s forgotten already, I say, man. Let it pass
at that, and go ahead as though nothing had
happened. By the way, have you had supper&mdash;or
do you call it dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the first time Armstrong looked at the
speaker and, forgetting for the instant, he almost
smiled. The question was characteristic.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve already dined, thank you,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Without comment Roberts called up the <i>café</i>
and ordered delivered his customary busy-day
lunch of sandwiches and coffee.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m going East on the eleven-fifty limited
to-night,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and there are several
things I&#8217;ve got to see to first.&#8221; In voluntary
relaxation from work he slipped down in the big
chair until his head rested on the back. Thereafter
for a long time, for longer doubtless than
he realized, he sat so, looking at the other man;
not rudely or unpleasantly, but with the old,
absent, analytical expression large upon his face.
At last he roused.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he began abruptly, &#8220;you&#8217;re wondering
what it is I wish to speak with you about.
I&#8217;ll explain in advance that it&#8217;s of your personal
affairs purely, nothing else. Would you
prefer me not to intrude?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment Armstrong did not answer,
but with an effort he looked at the questioner
directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If it were a couple of days back,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I should have answered &#8216;yes&#8217; emphatically.
Now&mdash;&#8221; his glance wandered out the window,
resting on the brick wall opposite, &#8220;now I
hardly know. You&#8217;ve earned a sort of right
to wield the probe; and besides&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Never mind the right,&#8221; shortly. &#8220;I tell
you last night is forgotten. I meant to see you
and have the same talk anyway&mdash;with your
permission.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still Armstrong hesitated, looking steadily
away. &#8220;You&#8217;ve condoned the fact, then, that
I&#8217;ve cut you dead on the street regularly?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understood&mdash;and didn&#8217;t blame you.
There are dozens of people who know Old Man
Roberts and still never see him when passing
face to face. It&#8217;s all in the game.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
At last Armstrong&#8217;s glance returned, almost
with wonder. &#8220;And you don&#8217;t lay it up against
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sometimes. Usually, however, not. Life&#8217;s
too short to play with toys; and enmities are
toys&mdash;double-edged ones at that. You haven&#8217;t
answered my question yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know; but just a moment more. Do you
recall, by the way, a prophecy I made once,
years ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; it never came true as far as I am
concerned.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps you never had cause to have it do
so.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;With me it did come about. I&#8217;ve hated you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
ever since&mdash;from the day you left. Do you
realize why I haven&#8217;t answered your question?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, why you haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;m still waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; mused Armstrong, &#8220;why
I don&#8217;t hate you, now that we&#8217;re here together.
I&#8217;ve thought a lot of bitter things about you,
more than about any one in the world. I don&#8217;t
know why I don&#8217;t say them now that I&#8217;ve got
the chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, you have the chance. I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know.&#8221; Armstrong&#8217;s long fingers were
twitching nervously. Despite an effort to prevent
his lower lip trembled in sympathy. &#8220;And
still, now that for the first time I have the
chance, I can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t want to. I&mdash;&#8221; Of a
sudden an uncontrollable moisture came into his
eyes, and he shifted about abruptly until his face
was hid. &#8220;Damn you, Darley Roberts!&#8221; he
stormed inadequately, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to a bit,
but after all I trust you and&mdash;and like you.
You have my permission to intrude. I want
you to, have wanted you to a hundred times.&#8221;
The Rubicon was crossed at last and he made
the admission that for long had trembled on his
tongue. &#8220;Somehow I can&#8217;t get along without
you and keep my nerve. I think you&#8217;re the
only person in the world who even in a measure
understands me, and can maybe make a man of
me again.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/illus-278.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 401px; height: 498px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 401px;'>
&#8220;You mean to suggest that Elice,&#8221; he began, &#8220;that Elice&mdash;You dare to suggest that to me?&#8221; (<i>Page 107</i>)<br />
</p>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In his place Darley Roberts sat looking at the
other, merely looking at him. The silence grew
embarrassing, lasted into minutes; but still unconsciously
he remained as he was. At last suddenly
his eyes dropped and simultaneously the
fingers of his big hands twitched in a way that
heralded action. Whatever the problem of that
period of silence decision had come.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think I understand what you mean,&#8221; he
said deliberately. &#8220;Perhaps, too, it&#8217;s true. I
don&#8217;t know. Anyway I&#8217;ll try to play the
game&mdash;try to.&#8221; He remembered, and the
hands lay still. &#8220;By the way, you&#8217;re not working
now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Have you anything definite in sight?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Despite the permission he had granted but a
moment before Armstrong colored; with an
effort he met his questioner frankly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s good. It occurred to me that it
might clear the atmosphere here a bit if you
went away for a time. What do you say to
McLean&#8217;s for a couple of weeks?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
On Armstrong&#8217;s face the red of a moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
ago changed to white, a white which spread to
his very lips.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And take the cure, you mean! Do you
think, really, it&#8217;s as bad with me as that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; bluntly; &#8220;I&#8217;d have said so if I had.
But just because you might not contract pneumonia
is no reason for not wearing an overcoat
when the thermometer is at zero. I&#8217;d go if I
were you, just as I&#8217;d be vaccinated if there was
an epidemic of small-pox prevalent.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But the admission! A confirmed alcoholic!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Confirmed nothing. Your going is no one&#8217;s
business but your own. The place is a general
sanatorium; it&#8217;s advertised so. Anyway you will
have good company. The biggest bondholder in
the Traction Company is there now. Do you
happen to have the money that you&#8217;ll need
convenient?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. That&#8217;s another rub; and besides&mdash;on
the square, Darley, I don&#8217;t need to do that&mdash;yet.
I know after last night things look bad;
but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understand perfectly. Let&#8217;s not waste
ammunition on a man of straw. The change
will do you good, though, anyway. I&#8217;d go myself
for the sake of that big marble plunge if
I could spare the time.&#8221; He was writing a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
check swiftly. &#8220;Pay it back when something
drops,&#8221; he proffered; &#8220;there will be something
develop soon&mdash;there always is. By the way,
why not go along with me to-night? It&#8217;s on
the same road.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong accepted the slip of paper mechanically;
a real moisture came into his eyes, and
he held it back at arm&#8217;s length.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley, confound you,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;I
can&#8217;t accept that. I simply can&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Can&#8217;t&mdash;why? It&#8217;s good. Try it anywhere
down town.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t mean that; but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes&mdash;&#8221; The big fingers were twitching
ominously.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But after&mdash;what&#8217;s past&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you make me a loan if positions
were reversed?&#8221; shortly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, certainly; but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Forget it, then.&#8221; Roberts turned back to his
desk abruptly. &#8220;Pardon me if I go on working.
I&#8217;ve simply got to clear this desk before
I go.&#8221; He waited in silence until the other man
started to leave; just as Armstrong reached the
door he wheeled about.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be with me at eleven-fifty sure, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he asked directly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong hesitated, his eyes averted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Good. I&#8217;ll attend to the reservations for
both of us. Travel East is light now and we&#8217;ll
have things practically to ourselves. There are
a number of other things I wish to talk with
you about&mdash;and we&#8217;ll have all night to do it
in. I suppose you&#8217;ll see Elice this evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Armstrong colored. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he repeated
uncertainly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Tell her, please, for me that I&#8217;ll be out of
town for about three weeks. Meanwhile the car
is subject to her order. I left directions at the
garage. If it&#8217;s convenient for you to happen
around this way about train time there&#8217;ll be a
cab waiting. Good-bye until then.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For two hours thereafter Roberts worked
steadily&mdash;until every scrap of correspondence
on the desk had been answered or bore memoranda
for the instruction of the stenographer on
the morrow. At last he took down the &#8217;phone.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Randall? There&#8217;ll be a carriage call for
my baggage shortly. It&#8217;s all ready. Thanks.
By the way, have you that manuscript handy
I spoke to you once about? All right. Tuck
it in somewhere while you think of it, please.
You&#8217;re still of the same opinion, that it&#8217;s good;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
at least worth a hearing? Very well. It&#8217;ll be
published then. I&#8217;m accepting your judgment.
Never mind how. This is between you and
me absolutely. I&#8217;m not to figure&mdash;ever. If
it goes flat he&#8217;ll have had his chance. That&#8217;s
all any of us can have. By the way, again.
I&#8217;m sorry to miss Mrs. Randall&#8217;s dinner-party.
I&#8217;m not often honored in that way. Anyway,
though, perhaps it&#8217;s as well. I&#8217;m impossible
socially; and, fortunately, I know just enough
to realize it. Yes; that&#8217;s all. Good-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Thereafter he waited until he got &#8220;Central&#8221;
on the wire.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Call me at eleven-thirty,&#8221; he requested.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be asleep, so ring me long and loud.
Eleven-thirty sharp, remember, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
He hung up the instrument with a gesture
of relief and leaned back in his chair, his great
bushy head against the bare oak, his big hands
loose in his lap. A half-minute perhaps he sat
so&mdash;until the eyes slowly closed and, true to
his word, and swiftly as a child at close of day,
he fell asleep.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
At eleven o&#8217;clock the watchman of the building,
noticing the light, came to investigate. A
moment he stood in the open door, an appreciative
observer. On tiptoe he moved away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Some one&#8217;s paying good and plenty for
this,&#8221; he commented <i>sotto voce</i> and with a knowing
wag of the head. &#8220;The old man&#8217;s all in&mdash;and
he isn&#8217;t doing it for his health alone,
you bet!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>TRAVESTY</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Out in the street, in front of the Gleason
cottage, the red car glistened in the moonlight.
In the shade of the familiar veranda
Roberts tossed his gauntlets and cap on the floor
and drew forth two wicker rocking-chairs where
they would catch the slight midsummer night
wind.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Hottest night of the season, I fancy,&#8221; he
commented, as he helped his companion remove
her dust coat and waited thereafter until she
was seated before he took the place by her side.
&#8220;Old Reliable number two certainly did us a
good turn this evening. Runs like an advertisement,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was a minute before the girl answered.
&#8220;Yes. It sounds cheap to say so, but at times,
like to-night, it almost seems to me Paradise.
It makes one forget, temporarily, the things one
wishes to forget.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said her companion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I suppose people who have been accustomed
to luxuries all their lives don&#8217;t think of it at
all; but others&mdash;&#8221; She was silent.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Roberts again, &#8220;I think I understand.
It&#8217;s the one compensation for being
hungry a long time, I suppose; the added enjoyment
of the delayed meal when at last it is
served. At least that&#8217;s what those who never
went hungry say. I hope you&#8217;ll get a lot of
pleasure out of the machine this Summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl looked at him quickly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I? Are you going away again?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. I start West to-morrow. Things are
moving faster than I expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you won&#8217;t take the car with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I shan&#8217;t play again for a time. I always
had a theory that a man should know a
business he conducts, not take some one else&#8217;s
word for it. I&#8217;m going to put on my corduroys
and live with that mine until it grows up.
I don&#8217;t even know how long that will be. In
a way to-night is good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl said nothing this time.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I meant what I said, though, in regard to
the car,&#8221; returned Roberts. &#8220;I shall be disappointed
if you don&#8217;t use it a lot. I&#8217;ve always
felt as though it sort of belonged to us together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
we&#8217;ve had such a lot of pleasure out of it in
common. They tell me at the garage that while
I was away last time it wasn&#8217;t out at all.
Didn&#8217;t Steve deliver my message?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you promise to do differently the rest
of the season?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the girl paused before she answered.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; she said then. &#8220;You understand
why?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not if I request otherwise?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t request it, please,&#8221; swiftly, &#8220;as a
favor. I repeat, you understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Understand, certainly, what you mean to
imply.&#8221; The big hands on the man&#8217;s knees
drooped a little wearily. &#8220;You don&#8217;t trust me
wholly, even yet, do you, Elice?&#8221; he added
abruptly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Trust you! That&#8217;s a bit cruel.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man shifted in his seat unconsciously.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If it was I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said gently.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend it so. I suppose I&#8217;m wrong;
but what others, mere observers, say seems to
me so trivial. The gossip of people who&#8217;d knife
you without compunction the instant your back
was turned for their own gratification or gain&mdash;to
let them judge and sentence&mdash;pardon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
me once more. I shan&#8217;t mention the matter
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl looked steadily out into the night,
almost as though its peace were hers. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
she returned, &#8220;you are wrong&mdash;but in a different
way than you intimated. It isn&#8217;t what
others would say at all that prevents my accepting,
but my own judgment of myself. You&#8217;ve
done so many things for me; and I in return&mdash;I&#8217;m
never able to do anything whatever. It&#8217;s
a matter of self-respect wholly. One can&#8217;t accept,
and accept, and accept always&mdash;in the
certainty of remaining permanently in debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man looked at her oddly. Then he glanced
away.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I suppose not,&#8221; he acquiesced.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If there were anything I could do for you
in turn to make up even partially; but you&#8217;re
so big and independent and self-sufficient&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Self-sufficient!&#8221; Roberts caught the dominant
word and dwelt on it meditatively. &#8220;I
suppose I am that way. It never occurred to
me before.&#8221; The big hands tightened suddenly,
their weariness gone. &#8220;But let&#8217;s forget it,&#8221; he
digressed energetically. &#8220;This is the last time
I&#8217;ll see you for a long time, months at least;
and a lot can happen in months sometimes. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
future is the Lord&#8217;s, but the present is ours.
Let&#8217;s enjoy it while we may. What, by the
way, are you going to do the remainder of the
Summer?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do?&#8221; The girl laughed shortly. &#8220;What
I&#8217;m doing now, I fancy, mostly. Father will
be away the first week in September. I promised
Margery I&#8217;d stay with her during that
time; otherwise&mdash;&#8221; A gesture completed the
sentence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts looked at her oddly. &#8220;Is that what
you want to do&mdash;you?&#8221; he asked bluntly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Want to do?&#8221; Again the laugh. &#8220;What
does it matter what I want to do?&#8221; She caught
herself suddenly. &#8220;Margery and I may go
away to a lake somewhere during that week,&#8221;
she completed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And after that?&#8221; suggested the man.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The university will be open then. I&#8217;ve secured
a place this year,&mdash;assistant in English.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;re really serious, Elice?&#8221; soberly.
&#8220;This is news to me, you know. You really
purpose teaching in future?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She returned her companion&#8217;s look
steadily. &#8220;Father was not reappointed for the
coming session. He&#8217;s over the age line. I
supposed you knew.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t know before.&#8221; Without apparent
reason Roberts stood up. The great
hands were working again. A moment he stood
there so, the big bushy head outlined distinctly
against the starlit sky; with equal abruptness
he returned to his seat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What a farce this is you and I are playing,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Do you really wish it to go
on longer?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl did not look at him, did not move.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Farce?&#8221; she echoed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man gestured swiftly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, please,&#8221; he prevented. &#8220;You
and I know each other entirely too well to pretend.
I repeat, do you wish this travesty to
go on indefinitely? If you do I accept, of
course&mdash;but&mdash;do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Instinctively, as on a former occasion, the
girl drew her chair farther back on the porch,
until her face was in the shadow. It was out
of the shadow that she spoke.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Prefer it to go on? Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;because
I wish you to remain as you are now. But
really wish it, no; because it&#8217;s unfair, wholly
unfair.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unfair to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the second time Roberts gestured. &#8220;Take
that consideration out of the discussion absolutely,
please,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With that understanding
do you still wish this pretence to go
on?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wish to keep your friendship.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;My friendship&mdash;nothing more? I&#8217;m brutally
blunt, I realize; but I can&#8217;t let to-night,
this last night, go by without knowing something
of how you feel. You never have given
me even so much as a hint, you know. I&#8217;ve
waited patiently, I think, for you to select the
moment for confidence; but you avoid it always;
and to-morrow at this time&mdash;You know I
love you, Elice. Knowing that, do you still wish
me to go away pretending merely polite friendship?
Do you wish it to be that way, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl ignored the question, ignored all except
the dominant statement.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know you love me,&#8221; she echoed.
&#8220;You told me so once before.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Once! A thousand times; you understood
the language. It seems foolish even to reiterate
the fact now. And yet you&#8217;ve never answered.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know. I said it was unfair; and still&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You won&#8217;t answer even yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m drifting and waiting for light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
Don&#8217;t misunderstand; that isn&#8217;t religion&mdash;I&#8217;ve
not been to church in a year, or said a prayer.
It isn&#8217;t that at all. I simply don&#8217;t want to hate
myself, or be hated by another justly later.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you expect to drift on until that light
comes?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A halt, long enough for second thought or
renewal of a decision. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do otherwise.
There&#8217;s no other way. It&#8217;s inevitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Inevitable!&#8217;&#8221; Roberts shrugged impatiently.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the word. It belongs in
the same class with &#8216;chance&#8217; and &#8216;predestination&#8217;
and &#8216;luck.&#8217; There are few things inevitable
except death.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;This is one&mdash;that I must wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you can&#8217;t even take me into your confidence,
about the reason why? Mind, I don&#8217;t
ask it unless you voluntarily desire. I merely
suggest.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; steadily; &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you the reason.
I&#8217;ve got to decide for myself&mdash;when light
comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts&#8217; great shoulders squared significantly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But if I know it already,&#8221; he suggested
evenly, &#8220;what then?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
No answer, although the other waited half a
minute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat: what if I know it already?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts&#8217; glance wandered into the shadow
where the girl was, then returned slowly to the
street and the red car.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I rode East with Steve Armstrong,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;as far as he went. I also wired him when I was
coming, and we returned together. He told me,
I think, everything&mdash;except about your father.
He forgot that, if he knew. Do you doubt I
know the reason, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Out of the shadow came the girl&#8217;s face,&mdash;the
face only.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You did this for Stephen Armstrong&mdash;after
what is past! Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Because life is short and I wanted to know
several things before I came to-night. Would
you like to hear what it was I wished to learn?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the face vanished.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said a voice.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know already, so it won&#8217;t be news. One
was that he still cares for you&mdash;as always. He
perjured himself once, because he thought it was
his duty; but he has never ceased to care. The
other thing was that he&#8217;s changed his mind and
is going back to his literary work. His novel,
that was accepted tentatively, will be published
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
next Winter. What else I learned is immaterial.
I don&#8217;t often venture a prediction, but in
his case I&#8217;ll make the exception. I believe that
this time he&#8217;ll make good. He has the incentive&mdash;and
experience. Do you still doubt I know
the reason, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. But that you should tell me this!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I claim no virtue. You knew it already.
I&#8217;m merely attempting to simplify&mdash;to aid the
coming of the light.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the second time out of the shadow came
the girl&#8217;s face, her whole figure. &#8220;Darley Roberts,&#8221;
asked a voice, &#8220;are you human, or aren&#8217;t
you? I don&#8217;t believe another man in the world
would, under like circumstances, do as you have
done by Steve Armstrong. I can&#8217;t believe you
human merely.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man smiled oddly; the look passed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I have merely played the game fair,&#8221; he
explained dispassionately, &#8220;or tried to, according
to my standard. Like yourself, I don&#8217;t want
to hate myself in the future, whatever comes.
The hate of others&mdash;I&#8217;m indifferent to that,
Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still you love me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I shall never care for another, never. The
time when I could, if it ever existed, is past.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The white hands dropped helplessly into the
girl&#8217;s lap.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I thought I understood you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
yet, after all&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We live but once,&#8221; gently. &#8220;I wish you to
be happy, the happiest possible. Does that help?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&#8221; In a panic the face, the hands,
retreated back into the shadow again. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m afraid of you once more, afraid of you,&#8221; she
completed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment the man sat still; then came his
unexpected deliberate smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; not afraid. I repeat you know me absolutely,
and we&#8217;re never afraid of things we
know. I explained once before that that&#8217;s why
I went through the detail of telling you everything.
You&#8217;re not afraid of me in the least, any
more than I am afraid of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The smile still held.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, it isn&#8217;t fear of me that prevents
your answering.&#8221; Like a flash the smile vanished.
Simultaneously the voice dropped until
it was very low, yet very steady. &#8220;You love me
in return, Elice, girl. It isn&#8217;t that!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From the darkness silence, just silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I say, you love me in return. Can you
deny it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still not an answering sound nor a motion.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts drew a long breath. His big eloquent
hands hung free. &#8220;Shall I put in words the exact
reason you won&#8217;t answer, to prove I know?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The voice was just audible.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment Roberts paused. &#8220;It&#8217;s because
you are afraid, not of me, but of Steve Armstrong:
afraid of the way the Lord fashioned
him. Elice, come out into the light, please. We
must face this thing. You&#8217;re not his mother,
and you don&#8217;t love him otherwise. Tell me,
is a sentiment dead greater than one living?
Will you, must you, sacrifice the happiness of
two for the happiness of one? Answer me,
please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant the girl hesitated; obediently she
came out into the light, stood there so, her hand
on the pillar of the porch. She did not glance
at her companion, did not dare to do so.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I repeat, I can&#8217;t answer you yet,&#8221; she said
simply. &#8220;It&#8217;s bitter, cruel to you, I know, and
to myself; but it would be infinitely worse if&mdash;if
I made a mistake.&#8221; She paused, while a restless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
hand swept across her face. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help
feeling that I&#8217;m to blame a good deal already,
that if I hadn&#8217;t changed, and shown the
change&mdash;&#8221; She sat down helplessly, the sentence
incomplete. &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t bear to think of
it. It drives me mad. To feel you have the responsibility
of another&#8217;s very soul on your hands,
and to have failed in that trust&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop me. It&#8217;s true. If I had married
him years ago when he first wished me to do so
he&#8217;d never have gone down. I cared for him
then, or fancied I did so; and I could have held
him up. But instead&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice! I won&#8217;t listen. You&#8217;re morbid and
see ghosts where nothing exists. You&#8217;re no more
to blame for being human and awakening than
lightning is to blame when it strikes.&#8221; He stood
up, suddenly. &#8220;Besides, the past is dead. To
attempt to revive it is useless. The future alone
matters; and it&#8217;s that I wish to talk about. I
can&#8217;t bear to think of going away and leaving
you as you are now. It&#8217;s preposterous. If you
cared for Steve I shouldn&#8217;t insist for a moment,
or trouble you again so long as I lived; but you
don&#8217;t care for him.&#8221; He took a step forward,
and stopped where she must look him in the face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
&#8220;You don&#8217;t care for him, that way, do you,
Elice?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Straight in the eyes the girl answered his look.
But the lips spoke nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you do love me, love me, don&#8217;t you,
girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still not a word; only that same steady look.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice,&#8221;&mdash;the man&#8217;s hands were on her shoulders,
holding her immovable,&mdash;&#8220;answer me.
This is unbearable. Don&#8217;t you love me? Say it.
I must know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Bit by bit the long lashes dropped, until
the dark eyes were hid. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say it yet,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;you know that. Don&#8217;t compel me
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Cannot or will not?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Still no answer, merely silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Just noticeably the man&#8217;s big hands tightened
their grip. &#8220;I can make you very happy, Elice,
girl,&#8221; he voiced swiftly; &#8220;I know it; because I
have the ability and I love you. I&#8217;ll take you
away, to any place in the world you wish to go,
stay as long as you wish, do whatever you choose.
I&#8217;ll give you anything you want, anything you
ever wanted. I have the power to do this now,
and I&#8217;ll have more power in future. Nothing
can stop me now or prevent, except death alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Say the word and I&#8217;ll not go West to-morrow.
Instead, we&#8217;ll begin to live. We&#8217;re both starved
for the good things that life has to offer. We&#8217;ll
eat our fill together, if you but say the word.
We&#8217;ve wasted years&mdash;both of us, long, precious
years. There&#8217;s a big, big debt owing us; but
at last, at last&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley Roberts!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man suddenly halted, passive.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize what you&#8217;re doing, what
you&#8217;re saying. It&#8217;s unworthy of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment longer the grip of the big hands
still clung as it was. They dropped, and the
man drew back.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unworthy?&#8221; He looked at her steadily.
&#8220;Can you fancy I was trying to&mdash;buy you? I
thought you realized I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I do. But&mdash;you&#8217;re only making it harder
for me&mdash;to do right.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do right?&#8221; Once more the echo. &#8220;Right!&#8221;
He laughed, as his companion had never before
heard him laugh. &#8220;I wonder if it is right to
make a certain cripple of one human being on
the chance of making a real weakling less weak?
Right to&mdash;&#8221; a sudden tense halt. &#8220;I beg your
pardon,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that. Forget
that I said it.&#8221; He stooped to pick up his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
cap and gauntlets. When he came forward
once more he was himself again, as he would be
from that moment on.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fancy for a minute I mean to hurt
you, or to make it harder for you now,&#8221; he said
steadily; &#8220;but this is the end, you realize, the
turning of the ways&mdash;and I must be sure. You
still can&#8217;t give me an answer, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl did not look at him this time, did
not stir.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, not even yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A pause, short this time.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you won&#8217;t reconsider about going to
work for a living, won&#8217;t let me help, as a friend,
merely as a friend? You know me too well
to misunderstand this. It would mean nothing
absolutely to me now to help, and would not
alter our friendship, if you wish, in the least.
Won&#8217;t you let me do this trifle for you if I
ask it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Resolutely the girl shook her head, very
steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understand and appreciate,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment longer the man waited. He extended
his hand. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more to be
said, then, I fancy, except good-bye.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the first time in that long, long fight
the girl weakened. Gropingly she found the
extended hand; but even then the voice was
steady.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said&mdash;and that was all.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>CELEBRATION</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It had been a gay dinner, a memorable dinner.
The mere ostensible occasion of its being in
celebration of the publication of Steve Armstrong&#8217;s
first novel, &#8220;The Disillusioned,&#8221; would
of itself have been sufficient reason therefor. In
addition, the resignation, by a peculiar coincidence
to take effect the same day, of the former
manager of the Traction Company, Darley Roberts,
with a recommendation that was virtually
a command for the advancement of his acting
assistant, Harry Randall, to his place, added
another reason no less patent. If a cloud existed
that evening to mar the happiness of those four
long-time friends gathered in commemoration of
the dispensation of Providence jointly enjoyed,
it most emphatically had not lifted its head
above the surface. Never had Margery Randall
bubbled with more spontaneous abandon; or,
even in the old university days, had Elice Gleason
laughed more easily. And as for Steve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Armstrong, the guest of honor, the conquering
hero,&mdash;it was his hour and in its intoxicating
completeness he had enjoyed it to the full; had
stretched it on and on that he might enjoy it
again. Now, the last course served, the last toast
proposed and drunk in inadequate chocolate, and
the two girl friends, after the habit of old acquaintances,
left to their own private confab,
Randall and Armstrong drifted instinctively
upstairs to the former&#8217;s den for their after-dinner
smoke. In absolute well-being, too keen
almost for words, Armstrong dropped into a big
leather chair, facing his host.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;By Jove, Harry,&#8221; he commented explosively,
&#8220;I tell you this is something like living.
I never enjoyed myself so much before in my
life.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Harry Randall, decidedly stouter than the
Randall of professor days, smiled appreciatively
as he selected a cigar from the convenient
humidor.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, the world does look rather bright to me
to-night, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; he acquiesced.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Bright!&#8221; Armstrong laughed outright in
pure animal exuberance. &#8220;It&#8217;s positively dazzling:
the more so by comparison.&#8221; He looked
at his companion with the frank understanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
of those long and intimately acquainted. &#8220;What
a change a few short years can make sometimes,
can&#8217;t they? What an incredible change!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Harry Randall returned the look, but gravely
this time.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been thinking of that all the
evening,&#8221; he said simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So have I.&#8221; Armstrong laughed shortly;
&#8220;that is, when I haven&#8217;t been too irresponsibly
happy to think at all. Just to get my bearings
I tried to fancy myself back where I was once
when I came to tell my troubles to you; and
went to pieces at the end of the narrative.&#8221; He
gestured eloquently. &#8220;What a fool I was and
what a liar to swear I&#8217;d never do any more
literary work, or permit a book of mine to be
published in any circumstances, ever!&#8221; Once
more the gesture, ending in an all-comprehensive
shrug. &#8220;Bah! I don&#8217;t like to think of it.
The whole thing&#8217;s a nightmare, neither more
nor less!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Harry Randall did not smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; the past was a little that way,&#8221; he
echoed again.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For perhaps half a minute Armstrong smoked
in reminiscent gravity; swiftly as the shadow
had intruded it passed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Let&#8217;s forget it,&#8221; he proposed, &#8220;forget it
absolutely and never speak of it again. By the
way, do you own this place now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; Roberts still holds it. I made him an
offer before he went away last Summer, but he
wouldn&#8217;t even consider it then. I&#8217;ll try again
when he returns. Margery wants it badly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;When he returns? Is he coming back soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I judge so, although I&#8217;ve had no word.
There were a number of letters and telegrams
came for him yesterday, and a batch of them to-day.
I suspect that he intended being here to-night
and is delayed for some reason.&#8221; Randall
removed his glasses and polished them with unnecessary
diligence. &#8220;I wired him when I heard
what he&#8217;d done for me, but I haven&#8217;t had any
answer yet. I&#8217;d have given anything to have
had him here to-night. It was the one thing
lacking.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a moment there was silence.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He has done a lot for you, Harry, that&#8217;s a
fact,&#8221; commented Armstrong, judicially. &#8220;Your
new place at six thousand dollars a year is a
pretty good thing even for these days.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;A lot? Everything! He pulled me out of
hell and gave me a chance when I&#8217;d never have
made one myself. I owe him everything; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
I&#8217;ve never been able to do him one blessed service
in return.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong squirmed uncomfortably. The
usually reticent Harry Randall like this was a
novelty.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;For that matter, he&#8217;s done a lot for both
of us,&#8221; admitted Armstrong, perfunctorily. &#8220;I
appreciate it too, thoroughly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall looked up swiftly; in remembrance
equally swift he turned away.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; he&#8217;s done miracles for both of us, more
than we can possibly realize,&#8221; he said softly.
&#8220;More&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Harry,&#8221; interrupted Margery Randall&#8217;s voice
from the stairway, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hasten you
men, but Elice thinks she must go. Her father
isn&#8217;t well, you know, and is at home alone.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait, Elice. It&#8217;s early yet. See how
your father is and come down when you can.&#8221;
Armstrong looked at her meaningly, with all
but an appeal. &#8220;This is my night, you know.
You really can&#8217;t refuse to let me see you
to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl busied herself with the lights and the
gas in the grate.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know, Steve; but really I&#8217;d rather not see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
any one longer to-night.&#8221; She took off her coat
almost hurriedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a busy time for me now
before the holidays; and with father as he is&mdash;That&#8217;s
why I came away so early, you know.
Not to-night, please, Steve.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong silently paced the length of the
little library, pitifully bare in comparison with
the home they had just left. He halted.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do you realize that you&#8217;ve invariably prevented,
by one excuse or another, my talking with
you alone in months now?&#8221; he asked abruptly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mean ever to give me a chance
again? You know what it is I wish to speak
about, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl was standing&mdash;quite still now.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know what it is you wish,&#8221; she
corroborated.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong fingered the gloves in his hand
nervously. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to listen then?
I won&#8217;t attempt to make any apologies for the
past. I can&#8217;t. But I&#8217;d hoped you&#8217;d forgotten,
or at least forgiven, by this time. I&#8217;ve tried to
make good, honestly, Elice; and to-night particularly&mdash;don&#8217;t
stand me in the corner any longer,
please. I&#8217;ve been punished enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Punished!&#8221; The girl wheeled. &#8220;I
wonder&mdash;&#8221; She checked herself suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she digressed swiftly,&mdash;&#8220;wait.
I&#8217;ll be back soon,&#8221; and she was gone.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Alone Armstrong threw hat and topcoat into
a chair almost irritably; walking over to the
grate, he stood gazing down into the blaze absently.
For some reason it called to mind another
grate and another occasion when he had
looked absently therein; and almost unconsciously
he caught himself glancing at the shelf
above, half expecting to catch the play of light
from a red decanter thereon. With the shrug
of one who banishes an unpleasant memory he
turned away. He was still standing, however,
when the girl returned.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Is there any way I can assist, with your
father?&#8221; he asked perfunctorily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, thank you. He&#8217;s asleep. It&#8217;s mental,
the trouble with him, more than anything else.&#8221;
She sat down and indicated a place opposite.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad Harry Randall escaped in time.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And I as well?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, and you, assuredly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong waited; but she said no more, and
with an odd diffidence he cleared his throat
unnecessarily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s sacrilege, though, for us to talk commonplaces
to-night,&#8221; he anticipated hastily. &#8220;There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
too much else to discuss, and to-day has meant
too much. Do you realize what this day really
means for both of us, Elice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The long fingers lay in the girl&#8217;s lap, quite
still.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps. But tell me if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the fantastic diffidence held Armstrong
in its grip; and again he freed himself with an
effort.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It means, first of all, that at last I&#8217;m on my
feet, where I&#8217;ve always wished to be. It means
that I&#8217;m to have my chance&mdash;and that again
means independence.&#8221; He overlooked absolutely
the egotism of the statement, was unconscious
of it. Success loomed too big and incontestible;
possible future failure lay too remote
to merit consideration. &#8220;It means all of this;
but beyond that it means that I have the right
to tell you again that I love you. You know I
love you, as always, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As always?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Forget, please. This is to-day; my day,
our day. You don&#8217;t doubt I love you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t doubt it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong breathed deep. An instinct all
but overwhelming impelled him to rise, to&mdash;he
substituted with his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You realize all that I wish to say,&#8221; he said
swiftly, &#8220;so why make a farce of it by words?
We&#8217;ve drifted apart for a long time, a hideously
long time, and it&#8217;s been my fault throughout;
but now that it&#8217;s over won&#8217;t you come back
to the beginning, Elice, to the place where we
separated?&#8221; He halted for breath, for words
where none were adequate. &#8220;I want you, Elice,
want you&mdash;now and always. Tell me, please,
that you&#8217;ve forgiven me, that you&#8217;ll come
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In the girl&#8217;s lap the hands crossed steadily;
again that was the only move she made.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So far as I am concerned there&#8217;s nothing
to forgive, nor has there ever been,&#8221; she said
gently. &#8220;As for going back, though, I can&#8217;t;
because I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s useless to lie, for you&#8217;d
find me out. I&#8217;ve simply awakened.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You mean you&mdash;don&#8217;t care for me any
more?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; I care for you very much; but not in
that way. It was so before the end came. I
awoke before that.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still you would have married me then.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl did not answer, did not even look up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And now,&#8221; he repeated insistently, &#8220;tell me;
and now?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time the brown eyes lifted, met his
steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unless something happens I can&#8217;t marry
you now,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong looked at her; at first dazedly,
then with a trace of color gathering under his
fair skin.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Unless something happens?&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;Pardon me, but what do you mean by
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;I was thinking of
something else. I hate to hurt you; but as I
said before, it&#8217;s useless to temporize. I can&#8217;t
marry you now, Steve.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In his place Armstrong settled back dumbly.
Unconsciously he passed his handkerchief over
his mouth. The hand that carried it trembled
a bit.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You really mean that, do you?&#8221; he groped,
half to himself, &#8220;mean the break to be really
final this time?&#8221; He shut his eyes, like a child
suddenly awakened in the dark and afraid.
&#8220;Somehow I hadn&#8217;t expected that at all, hadn&#8217;t
planned on it. I suppose it was childish of me;
but I&#8217;ve been taking things for granted, on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
strength of the past, and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; Of a sudden
the rambling tongue halted. The eyes opened
wide, unnaturally wide; and in their depths was
again that new look of terror, but now magnified.
&#8220;Tell me that you don&#8217;t mean it,
Elice, really,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I was just beginning
to live and hope again; and now&mdash;tell
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Long before this the girl had ceased looking
at him. Instead, with the instinctive fascination
an open fire exerts over all human beings,
she had turned toward the tiny jets of gas in
the grate; her face propped in her hands she
sat staring into the depths of the flame. She
scarcely seemed to breathe, even when she
spoke.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I meant it,&#8221; she repeated patiently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For a long time there was silence,&mdash;long
enough with the man for the mood to pass, the
mood of terror, and in reaction its antithesis,
reckless abandon, to come in its stead. For come
it did, as was inevitable; and heralding its approach
sounded a laugh,&mdash;a sudden mirthless,
sarcastic laugh.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;So this is the end of my day,&#8221; he said. He
laughed again. &#8220;I might have known it was
too good to last. What a fool I was to imagine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
that just because one thing had come my
way everything else was going to follow suit.
What a poor, blithering fool!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; No lethargy in the girl&#8217;s figure
now, in the face of a sudden turned toward him
appealingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take it that way or say
such things. Nothing has changed in the least.
I&#8217;m still your friend, as I&#8217;ve always been; so
is Harry Randall&mdash;and the rest. You&#8217;re still
a successful writer; you&#8217;ve proved it to-day, and
you&#8217;ll prove it further with the new book you&#8217;re
working on now. I repeat, nothing has altered
in the least. Don&#8217;t talk that way. It hurts
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In his chair, erect now, Armstrong merely
smiled. But his color was higher than normal
and the blue eyes were unnaturally bright.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, nothing has changed, I suppose,&#8221; he
said evenly. &#8220;You&#8217;re right there. I&#8217;ve simply
been in a trance&mdash;that&#8217;s all&mdash;and I&#8217;ve inadvertently
come to. I seem to have the habit of
doing that.&#8221; He smiled again, hopelessly cruel
in his egotism. &#8220;Of course I have friendship,
oceans of it, yours particularly, as I&#8217;ve had all
the time. And success; it monopolizes the sky,
fairly blots out the stars, and obscures the sun
like an eclipse. There&#8217;s no end to the success
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
I have. It&#8217;s infinite. And still further, incentive:
to be and to do and to fight.&#8221; The smile
vanished. He could not mock in the face of
that thought even yet. &#8220;Incentive! What a
travesty. Elice, you&#8217;ve killed the last trace of
incentive I had just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s hands lifted imperiously.
&#8220;Stop. Have you no pity?&#8221; She
shook the swift-gathering flood from her eyes
rebelliously and faced him fair. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
very sorry you said such things after you&#8217;ve
had time to think,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Don&#8217;t add
regret to the rest to-night. Please don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Sorry, perhaps,&#8221; echoed the man, &#8220;and regret&mdash;possibly.
Anyway, what does it matter?
It&#8217;s true.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;True&mdash;no,&#8221; swiftly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it. I
won&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t say that. In pity, don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;But, I repeat, it is true,&#8221; doggedly. &#8220;I
at least can&#8217;t help that. Elice, don&#8217;t cry so!&#8221;
Of a sudden he was on his feet bending over
her. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t. I love you!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me! I can&#8217;t stand it!&#8221; The
girl had drawn away swiftly, the repression of
years for an instant broken. &#8220;You dare to tell
me that&mdash;now! Love&mdash;&#8221; She cut herself
short with an effort of will and, rising hurriedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
walked the length of the room to the window.
For more than a minute, while Armstrong stood
staring after her dumbly, she remained so; her
face pressed against the cold pane, looking out
upon the white earth. Deliberately, normally,
she turned. Seemingly without an effort, so
naturally that even Armstrong was deceived,
she smiled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; she said evenly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
often hysterical.&#8221; She was returning slowly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad when vacation comes. I think
I&#8217;m&mdash;tired.&#8221; She seated herself and motioned
the other back into his place,&mdash;a motion that
was a command. &#8220;Now, tell me, please, that
you didn&#8217;t mean what you said a moment ago
when we were both irresponsible. It will make
us both sleep better.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The smile had left Armstrong&#8217;s face now, and
in its place was the pallor of reaction. But he
was quiet also.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I wish I could,&#8221; he said steadily, &#8220;but I
can&#8217;t. It&#8217;ll be exactly as it was before.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl was still smiling,&mdash;that same normal,
apparently effortless, smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; she refuted, in tones deliberately
matter-of-fact. &#8220;There&#8217;s all the difference
in the world. Before you had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
audience. And now&mdash;the entire country will
listen now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; dully. &#8220;It&#8217;s always
been you that counted really. Success was an
incident, but you were the real incentive.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I?&#8221; She laughed gently. &#8220;On the contrary
it was I who tried to lead you away from
your work, to make you practical. Don&#8217;t you
remember the Graham offer?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; hurriedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of it a
thousand times. It was the big mistake of my
life when I refused his proposal. If I&#8217;d accepted
then&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;d not have been a successful writer
whose work goes on sale to-day in every city
in the United States.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Perhaps. But I would have had you. What
do I care for success in comparison to you!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Listening, just for an instant the girl&#8217;s nostrils
tightened; again she laughed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We seem to be travelling in a circle,&#8221; she
bantered, &#8220;and keep returning to the starting-point.
It&#8217;s discouraging.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s written,&#8221; said Armstrong, simply. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t avoid it. With me you&#8217;re the starting-point
as you&#8217;re the end, always. Didn&#8217;t you
recognize yourself so in the last novel?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl settled back in her seat wearily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You told me, I recall,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And in the one before?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You told me that also.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Armstrong was observing her steadily.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You are in the new one too,&#8221; he said; &#8220;the
one I&#8217;ve been working on&mdash;but which will never
be completed now. You&#8217;ve killed the girl there
too, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Steve!&#8221; The hands had gone swiftly to
the girl&#8217;s ears, covered them completely. &#8220;I
shan&#8217;t listen. This is worse than folly. It&#8217;s
madness.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; monotonously. &#8220;It&#8217;s myself.
I can&#8217;t avoid being myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nor I myself, Steve,&#8221; very gently. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you realize that?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man passed his hand across his eyes as
though brushing away something tangible.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t realize anything,&#8221; he said dully,
&#8220;except that I love you&mdash;and have lost. This
and that the world is dead&mdash;and I am alone
in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For the second time the girl arose, and even
yet quite steadily. But at last her lips were
trembling.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think you had better go now,&#8221; she requested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this much longer; and
besides, to keep it up would do no good that
I can see. To-morrow is Saturday, and if you
still feel there is anything you must say to me
I shall be at home all day. But to-night&mdash;please
go now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As in a dream, Armstrong arose, obeying her
command&mdash;as he always obeyed in small things.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he echoed
dully. &#8220;I realize I&#8217;m only making matters
worse by staying, only getting us farther apart.&#8221;
He buttoned his coat to the chin and drew on
his gloves lingeringly. &#8220;If I were to call
to-morrow, though, isn&#8217;t there a chance that
you would be different? Can&#8217;t I have even&mdash;hope?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl said nothing, did not appear to hear.
Subconsciously she was counting the seconds,
almost with prayer; counting until she should
be alone.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
But still Armstrong dallied, killing those same
seconds wilfully.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to offer me even hope,
Elice?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in&mdash;hell when
I go, without even hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the final straw, that prophetic suggestion,
the snapping straw. With one gesture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
of hopeless, impotent misery, of infinite appeal
as well, the girl threw out her hand.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Go,&#8221; she pleaded brokenly, &#8220;go quickly.
There&#8217;s a limit to everything and with me that
limit is reached.&#8221; She motioned again, and
Steve went out into the night.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ADMONITION</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There was a light in the den as Darley
Roberts, having let himself in with his
latch-key, started up the stairs toward his own
rooms, and, although he moved softly, Harry
Randall himself faced the newcomer on the
landing, his hand extended.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was waiting for you,&#8221; he announced without
preface. &#8220;I felt sure you&#8217;d be in to-night
sometime.&#8221; He was smiling a welcome, one
unmistakably genuine. &#8220;Delayed, were you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes. A wreck out about seventy miles. I
just got in on the relief,&#8221; laconically. The accompanying
grip, however, was not curt.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll read about it in the morning. Looks
comfortable in there,&#8221; with a nod toward the inviting
den. &#8220;Early enough yet for a chat, is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I was hoping so. That&#8217;s why I sat up.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll be with you in a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Shortly, in lounging-robe and slippers this
time, he came tiptoeing down the hall past the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
other sleeping-rooms; a big alert shape that
seemed mountainous beside the lesser Randall
idly awaiting his return.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he introduced characteristically
as he dropped into a convenient seat, &#8220;let&#8217;s hear
all about it&mdash;everything. I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall caught the contagion of brevity, as
he always did when in the other&#8217;s presence.
&#8220;What would you like to hear about first?&#8221; he
returned smilingly. &#8220;Have you any choice?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yourself,&#8221; with a steady look. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s
right, I see.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, everything&#8217;s right,&#8221; echoed Randall,
&#8220;so much so that I&#8217;m simply foolishly happy.&#8221;
He paused meaningly. &#8220;And now, since&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts gestured&mdash;merely gestured.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to permit me even to
thank you?&#8221; countered Randall.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I came to hear the news,&#8221; evenly. Roberts
smiled suddenly at the look on his companion&#8217;s
face. &#8220;I understand about that other matter,&#8221;
he digressed, ambiguously but nevertheless adequately;
&#8220;let it go at that. Mrs. Randall, I
presume&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;She hung your portrait, life size, in the
parlor downstairs a few days ago,&#8221; with direct
malice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again Roberts gestured; then he looked up.
They laughed together and the tabooed subject
by mutual consent passed into oblivion.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Miss Gleason&mdash;Elice&mdash;&#8221; suggested Roberts.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Still at her place in the university.&#8221; Randall
busied himself with a strand of lint on the
collar of his smoking-jacket. &#8220;Her father&#8217;s gone
all to pieces, you know, and she seems a bit&mdash;tired.
Otherwise she&#8217;s herself&mdash;as always.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Roberts. &#8220;And
Armstrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He&#8217;s been working steadily for months, and
been straight absolutely.&#8221; Randall ventured a
glance at last. &#8220;To-day was his big day; you
do know that. He was in the clouds this
evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I should like to have been with you.&#8221; The
tone was non-committal. &#8220;Strange to say I like
to see people in that frame of mind. It makes
for optimism. Will his new effort, you think,
stand on its own legs?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; always providing nothing interferes.
I&#8217;ve seen the first half. It&#8217;s more than good.
It&#8217;s excellent. You&#8217;re in it, distinct as life, by
the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts lit a cigar and smoked for a minute
in silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sincerely, that I&#8217;m there,&#8221; he
said then. He gazed at his companion steadily,
and with a significance Randall never forgot.
&#8220;I used to fancy I wasn&#8217;t afraid of anything.
I&#8217;m not afraid of most things,&mdash;dynamite or
nitro-glycerine or murderous fanatics or physical
pain; but in the last year I&#8217;ve learned there&#8217;s
one thing on earth, one person, I&#8217;m afraid of&mdash;deathly
afraid. You know who?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I predicted once he would make good. I
believed it then. Since I&#8217;ve been alone a good
deal and had much time to think, and question.
That&#8217;s why I am afraid.&#8221; Roberts
paused to smoke, seemingly impassive. &#8220;I&#8217;d
give every cent I have in the world and start
anew to-morrow without breakfast if I could
only know, only know to a certainty that he
would keep his grip. But will he?... I&#8217;m
afraid!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Scarcely knowing what he did, Randall lit a
cigar in turn and smoked like a furnace. His
tongue attempted to form an assurance, but try
as he might he could not give it voice. Once
he had promised not to lie to that man opposite,
ever; and in the depths of his own
soul he knew that he, too, was afraid. At last,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
in self-confessed rout, he voiced the commonplace.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s my turn to ask questions now, I think,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Are you back to stay?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts looked up, only half comprehending;
he roused himself.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. I intend to close out everything. I
doubt if I ever stay anywhere permanently
again. I&#8217;ll keep the house here, though.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve decided not to sell it&mdash;even to
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts paused.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said at last; but he offered no
explanation.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall waited, hoping for a lead whereby
light might come. But none opened, and the
subject dropped.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I judge the mine&#8217;s making good,&#8221; he commented,
with the trace of awkwardness he always
felt when approaching the other&#8217;s personal
affairs. &#8220;Will you return soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Probably not soon.&#8221; The voice was almost
listless. &#8220;I put everything in shape for an
indefinite absence before I came away. To
answer your question: It&#8217;s a wonder, bigger
than I ever hoped. It&#8217;ll still be a great mine
a generation from now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall caught his breath. The big game
was yet new to him, and the volume of wealth
suggested was cumulatively overpowering.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Bigger than you expected!&#8221; he echoed.
&#8220;Then that means&mdash;millions!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts glanced at his companion curiously.
Slowly he smiled.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it means millions. I haven&#8217;t
even an idea how many eventually.&#8221; The smile
left his face, every trace of expression as well.
&#8220;I could sell for ten to-day if I wished; but
I have no intention of selling.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall sat looking at the other as if hypnotized.
He forgot to ask questions, forgot almost
to breathe. To read of gigantic fortunes, the
property of absolute strangers living a thousand
or thousands of miles away, is one thing: to have
one personally known, an actual acquaintance
in possession&mdash;it held him speechless, staring.
The other&#8217;s familiar, tolerant laugh aroused him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please,&#8221; said Roberts. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
been doing that to me wherever I show myself
and write my name; that is, when they haven&#8217;t
been proving relationship.&#8221; He laughed again
shortly. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful how many relatives
I&#8217;ve discovered of late and friends I&#8217;ve made.
Don&#8217;t do it, please.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall could still color and his face went red.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he apologized, &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Nor that either,&#8221; swiftly, almost curtly.
&#8220;Just be yourself, natural. I like you that
way.&#8221; He looked at the other openly, with
frank intentness that heralded the unexpected.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s possible,&#8221; he digressed evenly, &#8220;that
I&#8217;ll be here some time, but the chances are I&#8217;ll
only stay a day or so. After to-night we&#8217;ll
probably not see much of each other, maybe
nothing at all, ever. We&#8217;re rather different
types and our roads lead differently.&#8221; He smiled
to dissipate the mystification he saw gathering
on the other&#8217;s face. &#8220;This is a preface. What
I&#8217;m aiming at directly is to say a thing or two
that have been on my mind for some time&mdash;in
case I don&#8217;t have the opportunity again.&#8221;
Once more the smile,&mdash;the same smile that had
won the confidence of the other against heavy
odds in the beginning of their acquaintance.
&#8220;Do you mind if I&#8217;m a bit&mdash;fatherly to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221; Swift as thought, as panoramic memory,
Harry Randall had remembered everything;
and, without shame, his eyes were moist. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like you to be so. I understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts looked away at the red and green
wall opposite.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s just this, then; and if you wish me to
stop say the word; I get reports of various
things in various ways. It&#8217;s part of my philosophy
to know of events in advance if I can.
I&#8217;ve heard that you are speculating a bit. Is
it true?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Randall started involuntarily; but the other
was not looking.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;How in the world did you know?&#8221; he
questioned.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Never mind how I know. I&#8217;d tell you if
it would do any good; but it wouldn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s
true, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Randall moistened his lips; &#8220;a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Things coming a trifle slow for you, are
they? Hard to meet expenses&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; it&#8217;s not that; but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I understand perfectly.&#8221; Roberts was still
inspecting the pattern of the paper with minute
attention. &#8220;As perhaps your best friend, though,
don&#8217;t do it. If at any time you need money,
really need it, remember I am your friend, and
don&#8217;t hesitate to tell me. But outside of that&mdash;&#8221;
He halted significantly, waiting; then, sufficient
time having elapsed, he looked at the other again
directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Now for the fatherly admonition,&#8221; he digressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
evenly, &#8220;or whatever you please to call
it. You&#8217;re doing well here, and will do better
as time goes by. You&#8217;re on your own feet, solid.
Don&#8217;t gamble with things as they are, ever. It&#8217;s
contagious, I know, when a man gets a little
surplus, and looking over the rise of the horizon
sees such an infinite field beyond; but steer clear.
Some men can gamble and lose, and forget it
and come up smiling again. Others are fashioned
by nature differently. Once down they
stay down; and regret as long as they live.
It&#8217;s a fundamental difference no power can
change. I hope I haven&#8217;t hurt you unforgivably,
Randall?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Harry Randall glanced up, and his eyes held
steady.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No; and I&#8217;ll not forget. I promise you
that.&#8221; Involuntarily he started to rise, his hand
half extended, his eyes bright; but he sat down
again. &#8220;If I could only thank you right,
Roberts,&#8221; he voiced tensely, &#8220;could only show
you in some way that I appreciate&mdash;&#8221; He
halted, the sentence so consciously inadequate,
incomplete,&mdash;&#8220;If I only could,&#8221; he repeated
helplessly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment they sat there so, looking at each
other, merely looking. Then at last, with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
obvious weariness Randall had never seen him
exhibit before, Roberts slowly arose. Still another
moment he stood there, looking down.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Roberts,&#8217;&#8221; he echoed in a low tone, &#8220;&#8216;Roberts,&#8217;
always &#8216;Roberts&#8217;! Not &#8216;Darley,&#8217; even
then.&#8221; He turned abruptly toward his own
rooms, his great shoulders all but blocking the
doorway as he passed out. &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he
said.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The light on the porch was dim, and as Elice
Gleason, answering the ring, opened the
outer door she stared as one who sees unbelievable
things. For a moment she did not utter a
sound, merely stood there gazing at the visitor
with a look that was only partially credulous;
in sudden weakness, oddly unlike her normal
composure, she covered her face with her hands.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice!&#8221; Unbidden, the man came wholly
within. &#8220;A thousand pardons for startling you.
I should have let you know&mdash;&#8217;phoned at least.
I&mdash;pardon me, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
With an effort the girl removed her hands, but
Darley Roberts saw she was still trembling.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No need to apologize.&#8221; She closed the door
mechanically. &#8220;You did surprise me, it&#8217;s true;
but that wasn&#8217;t the trouble really. I&#8217;ve been
expecting something to happen all day, something
that hasn&#8217;t happened yet, and when you
rang I fancied&mdash;&#8221; She laughed, as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
the inadequate explanation were complete and
withal a thing of trivial moment. &#8220;You remember
once I told you I believed, after all, you had
nerves. I&#8217;m making the tardy discovery that
I&#8217;ve got them myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
In his turn Roberts smiled and ignored the
obvious. He seldom anticipated, this man.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, we all have them, I guess,&#8221; he dismissed,
&#8220;along with an appendix and a few other
superfluous items.&#8221; He was still standing just
within the doorway. &#8220;First of all, though, I
don&#8217;t intrude? Harry Randall told me about
your father.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He&#8217;s been much better to-day, and he&#8217;s
asleep this evening already.&#8221; In swift reaction
the girl was herself again, more than her recent
self, positively gay. &#8220;Intrude!&#8221; she laughed
softly. &#8220;You&#8217;re actually becoming humorous;
and as you would say, your dearest enemies have
never accused you of that before. Come.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Between genteel poverty and absolute poverty
there are distinguishing signs and Darley Roberts
observed all things; but not once from his point
of vantage in the den he recalled so well did he
seem to take observations&mdash;any more than he
seemed to see the alteration, likewise unmistakable,
in the girl herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It seems as though it were only yesterday instead
of&mdash;I don&#8217;t like to think how many ages
ago, I was here last,&#8221; he commented as he relaxed
in familiar comfort. &#8220;If you just had one of
those linen things you used to work on, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The ball of white, like a crumpled handkerchief,
which had been lying idle in the girl&#8217;s lap
was unrolled and, before the speaker&#8217;s eyes, there
appeared against the colorless background a
clover with four leaves.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Elice!&#8221; It was unfeigned surprise. &#8220;Is this
another regiment or are you still working on that
last one yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl sorted her silks in demure impassivity.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Another regiment entirely&mdash;or is it an army?
I&#8217;ve forgotten how many comprise a regiment.&#8221;
She went to work with steady fingers. &#8220;These
lunch cloths of mine are becoming as staple as
soap or quinine.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts watched as the needle went through
and through, but he did not smile. He could
not.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Another regiment! Then I haven&#8217;t really
been sleeping,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For a moment when
that four-leafed clover showed&mdash;By the way,
do you happen to recall what day of the month
this is?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The girl&#8217;s eyes did not leave her
work. &#8220;I remembered it the first thing when
I got up this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You remembered? And still you were surprised
when I came. Didn&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d remember
too?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t doubt it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And come to commemorate the date, December
the sixth?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Commemorate, yes. Come? I didn&#8217;t know.
I hoped&mdash;until it grew dark; then&mdash;one loses
certainty alone after dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that which you had expected all
day to happen, though,&#8221; said Roberts, evenly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl did not dissimulate.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; she said simply.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
One step nearer had they approached the mystery,
one step only, but the man came no further&mdash;then.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And weren&#8217;t you going to commemorate it
yourself, since you remembered?&#8221; he digressed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I have done so. I&#8217;ve been celebrating
all day. I haven&#8217;t washed a dish; they&#8217;re all
stacked out in the kitchen. And this&mdash;&#8221; she
stood up deliberately and turned about that the
other might see&mdash;&#8220;is my party gown, worn in
honor of the occasion.&#8221; She returned to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
place and again the needle passed methodically
in and out of the linen. &#8220;Are you satisfied?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Satisfied!&#8221; It was the rebellious cry of a
dominant thing trapped and suffering. &#8220;Satisfied!&#8221;
By pure force of will he held back the
flood. &#8220;Elice, won&#8217;t you please put up that
work&mdash;for to-night? It&#8217;s&mdash;ghastly.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
As though paralyzed, the white hands paused,
for half a minute lay idle. Without comment she
obeyed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You know what I mean,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;It
makes me irresponsible. I want to throttle the
something somewhere to blame.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you. If
I had expected for an instant&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please!&#8221; It was supplication from
one accustomed to command. &#8220;Talk about human
beings being pawns in the game or straws
before the whirlwind!&#8221; Again the curt repression
by pure force of will, and the inevitable
pause with the digression complete following.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard your report of yourself yet,
Elice. It&#8217;s due me, overdue. I promised you
not to write, and kept my word, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl looked at him with eyes that tried to
smile.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Ask me anything else and I&#8217;ll answer,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
said. &#8220;This I can&#8217;t answer, because there&#8217;s
nothing to be said. I&#8217;ve merely been waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;As you were to-night, when I startled you?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl&#8217;s lips tightened, but they relaxed.
She was in command now.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the second step; and for the second
time the man approached no nearer&mdash;then.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me ask you questions instead,&#8221;
countered the girl, &#8220;as a favor?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Certainly, if you prefer.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;If I prefer.&#8217;&#8221; She mouthed the words deliberately.
&#8220;Very well, then. What have you
been doing since I saw you last?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts gave her an odd look.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Getting older mostly,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I might have chronicled that fact myself,&#8221;
echoed the girl.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Very fast,&#8221; added the man, evenly. &#8220;Did
you notice my hair?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It is grayer&mdash;a bit,&#8221; reluctantly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Grayer!&#8221; Roberts laughed. &#8220;I made a
microscopical examination recently for one hair
of the original color to preserve as a relic. It was
too late. Do you care to volunteer in the
search?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl ignored the invitation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;What else did you do?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Worked some.&#8221; Roberts held up his great
hands, calloused heavily over the palms. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
learned several things by actual experience: drilling,
dynamiting, sharpening steel, mucking ore,
assaying&mdash;everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And what else?&#8221; relentlessly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Prospected a little. Ran out of provisions
and went two days without a bite to eat. Returned
to find a strike on at the mine&mdash;and the
strikers in possession.&#8221; He halted reminiscently.
&#8220;I knocked a man down that day: the
leader. He dared me and there were a dozen
others backing him up. It was him or me and it
couldn&#8217;t be avoided. In the affair I hurt my
hand; while it was healing I went to &#8217;Frisco and
took in the theatres.&#8221; He held up the member
indicated, reversed this time for inspection. A
white jagged scar ran diagonally over the
knuckles. &#8220;It&#8217;s entirely well now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl caught her breath. No query this
time.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The hand returned idly to the man&#8217;s lap. He
looked away.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a rough life out there,&#8221; he resumed
evenly, &#8220;wild and primitive; but it&#8217;s fascinating
in a way. Besides, it&#8217;s one of the things I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
wanted to know. I think I do know it. I don&#8217;t
believe any one could fool me on a mine now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Elice Gleason looked at him steadily, until perforce
he returned her gaze.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Granted,&#8221; she admitted steadily; &#8220;but is it
worth while?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Worth while? How do I know&mdash;or any
one. It&#8217;s necessary for some one to know. It&#8217;s
part of the big game. Farther than that&mdash;My
hair is all gray now&mdash;and I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
His companion looked away, with a little gesture
of impatience.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Last of all, the mine itself?&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts hesitated, his face inscrutable as a
book closed.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;If I knew what you wanted to know,&#8221; he said
at last, &#8220;I&#8217;d tell you; but I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s fabulous,
if that answers your question. It&#8217;s like
Aladdin&#8217;s lamp: there&#8217;s nothing material on the
face of the earth it won&#8217;t give for the asking.
It&#8217;s producing enough now daily to keep a sane
man a year. It&#8217;s power infinite for good or
evil, and creating more power day by day.&#8221;
He halted, then unconsciously repeated himself.
&#8220;Yes, power infinite, neither more nor less.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
There was a long silence before his companion
spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And power, you said once, was the thing you
wanted most. You have it at last.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I have it at last, that&#8217;s true. I can command
the services of a thousand men, to work
for me or amuse me; or for another if I direct.
I can pass current anywhere at any time, and
make any one I care to name pass current with
me. The master key is in my possession tight.
I can choose my tools for whatever I wish done
from a multitude. The material is limitless, for
I can pay. Besides, as I said before, this power
is increasing inevitably, whether I&#8217;m asleep or
awake, growing by its own momentum. I have
it at last, yes; but it neither is nor ever was
what I wanted most, Elice. I said I wanted it,
you&#8217;re right; but I never said I wanted it most.
You know what I want most in the world,
Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Listening, Elice Gleason folded her hands
tight, until the blood left the fingers.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; she said steadily. &#8220;We
understand each other; it&#8217;s useless to pretend
otherwise. I&#8217;ve tried, and you&#8217;ve seen through
the disguise and smiled. It&#8217;s simply useless.&#8221;
The clasped hands opened in a gesture of dismissal.
&#8220;But don&#8217;t let&#8217;s speak of it now. I
want to hear your plans for the future. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
are you going to do now that you have&mdash;power?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Do?&#8221; Roberts looked at her steadily. &#8220;That
depends upon one condition absolutely. It&#8217;s
superfluous for me to name that one.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl flashed him a look from eyes unnaturally
bright.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Please,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;leave it alone for a
time. You have two courses outlined, an option.
It would be unlike you otherwise. What are
those two?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be insistent, Elice,&#8221; said
Roberts, gently. &#8220;Take my word for it, I shan&#8217;t
be again, whatever you decide. Yes; I see two
ways ahead. In one, work will be secondary,
another&#8217;s happiness first, always first. In the
other, I shall work&mdash;to forget. The incentive
of the game itself is gone. I&#8217;ve won the
game. But there is no other way to forget
and retain self-respect; so I shall work&mdash;to
the end.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And you must decide soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, at once. I can&#8217;t remain longer in uncertainty.
Nothing is so bad as that. It&#8217;s like
a bungling execution: infinitely better for all
concerned to be complete. To-morrow I take
up the trail one way or the other.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Opposite, the girl caught her breath for an
instant; but though the other saw he said nothing.
He had promised he would not.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll leave then to-morrow, if&mdash;&#8221; That
was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And never come back, never?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Not unless I am sent for. Life is short and
holds enough pain at best. I have several projects
in mind, and I shall be free to follow
them where they lead. I&#8217;ll go to Mexico
first. They&#8217;ve barely scratched the resources
down there. Later I go to South America.
Afterward&mdash;I haven&#8217;t planned. I&#8217;ll simply
follow the lead. There&#8217;s work enough to
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl looked at him&mdash;through eyes that
held their old marvel, almost their old fear.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You can cut yourself off so, from all the old
life, really?&#8221; she voiced.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was finality absolute, the last word, the
ultimatum.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And still you love me?&#8221; breathed the girl
low.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;More than I love life. You don&#8217;t doubt it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
From her seat the girl arose abruptly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
passed the length of the room with long, unconscious
strides, like a man. She made no effort at
dissimulation or concealment now. The time for
that was past. She merely fought&mdash;openly,
but in silence. Once she sat down for a moment;
but for a moment only. Again she was on her
feet. A bit later she asked the time, and very
quietly Roberts told her. She went to the window
in the front of the house commanding the
street and scrutinized its length. She returned
and resumed her seat.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Can I help you in any way, Elice?&#8221; asked
Roberts, gently.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl shook her head.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No,&#8221; she said steadily. &#8220;No one can help
me. I can&#8217;t even help myself. That&#8217;s the curse
of it. There&#8217;s nothing to do but wait.&#8221; The
folded hands changed position one above the
other, and after a moment returned as before.
&#8220;Do you understand?&#8221; she queried without
preface.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
An instant Roberts hesitated, but an instant
only.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes, I think so. You intimated you were
expecting some one to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Something to happen,&#8221; substituted the girl.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s all the same,&#8221; evenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Silence followed for a space while they sat
there so; breaking it, the girl looked at the other
directly.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I have refused him definitely,&#8221; she said, without
consciousness of the seeming ambiguity of
the remark. &#8220;I did so last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; very low; and that was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl drew a long breath, like one preparing
for the unknown.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I could see no other way of finding out for
sure. Like yourself, nothing seemed to me so
bad as uncertainty.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; once more; just &#8220;yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;He sat just where you are sitting now; and
when I told him he laughed.&#8221; A second the
brown eyes dropped, then in infinite pathos they
returned to the listener&#8217;s face. &#8220;You know
how he laughs when he&#8217;s irresponsible. It was
horrible.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I know,&#8221; echoed Roberts. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard it.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;And then he went away. I sent him away.
I couldn&#8217;t stand any more then. It seemed to
me I&#8217;d go mad if I tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Although the room was warm, the girl was
shivering; rising, Roberts lit the gas in the
grate. But he said nothing, absolutely nothing.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Through wide-open eyes the girl watched him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
as he returned to his seat. Involuntarily she
threw out both arms in a gesture of impotency
absolute.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; she completed, &#8220;except that I
told him to return&mdash;if he felt he must. I&#8217;ve
been expecting him every minute all day; anticipating
horrors. But I haven&#8217;t heard a
word.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
It was the mystery at last, impersonate. Like
a live presence it stood there between these two
human beings in the room, holding them apart,
and each in his separate place.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Not for a moment but for minutes this time
they sat in silence. Neither thought of speaking
commonplaces now, nor again of things intimate.
The period for these was past; the
present too compellingly vital. What the man
was thinking he did not say nor reveal by so
much as an expression. He had given his word
not to do so; and with Darley Roberts a promise
was sacred. A question he did ask, though,
at last.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like me to go and find out
for certain, Elice?&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do so
if you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221; It was almost a plea. &#8220;We&#8217;ll find
out soon, very soon, I&#8217;m positive. I&#8217;ll know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
whatever he does. He&#8217;s certain to tell me; and
I wish you here if he comes. Besides, neither
of us could do anything whatever to alter the
inevitable, even if we tried. We must simply
wait; it can&#8217;t be much longer now.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Once more there was a long silence, ghastly
in its dragging moments, and again broken by
the man.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t trouble you to go through the argument
again, Elice,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or attempt to
alter your decision, whatever it may be. I can&#8217;t
presume to judge another&#8217;s soul. But, merely
to know for certain: you&#8217;ve decided positively
to marry him, if&mdash;&#8221; The sentence ended in
silence and a gesture.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
His companion did not answer, appeared almost
not to hear.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Tell me, please,&#8221; repeated the man gently.
&#8220;You may as well. It won&#8217;t hurt either of us
any more for you to say it&mdash;if you&#8217;ve so
decided.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the girl this time. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
tried and tried to find an escape; but there is
none.&#8221; She passed her hand over her throat as
though the words choked her, but her voice was
now steady. &#8220;His blood would be upon my
head, always, if I could prevent and still let him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
go&mdash;down. God help you and me both, but
I can&#8217;t do otherwise!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
A moment longer Roberts sat still&mdash;fixedly
still; he stood up, his great hands clenched until
they were as white as the scar itself.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better go now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;before
Armstrong comes.&#8221; The great shoulders
of him were swelling and receding visibly with
each breath. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, of course; but I
fear to go passive and unresisting to the stake
myself, and to remain passive and unresisting
when I saw the same fire that was to be my
fate touching you, scorching you slowly to death&mdash;and
for a fault that was neither of your making
nor mine, for which we are in no respect
responsible&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid that is beyond me,
Elice. I&#8217;d better go at once, before he comes.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No.&#8221; The girl, too, was on her feet facing
him. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t really mean
what you just said.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I? You believe in miracles. I&#8217;m
human and I&#8217;d throttle him if he came while
I was here&mdash;and came as he came once before!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Stop! in pity. If it does happen he&#8217;ll not
be to blame; it will be because he can&#8217;t help it.
You&#8217;re big and strong and he&#8217;ll need you as
well as me. Wait.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man drew back a step, but his great jaw
was set immovably.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;You can&#8217;t realize what you&#8217;re asking,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Remember my conviction is not your
conviction. I still believe that two predominate
over one and that nature&#8217;s law comes first. I&#8217;ll
go because it is your decision and final; but I
can&#8217;t change elemental things at command. Don&#8217;t
ask it or expect it, because it is impossible.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;It&#8217;s not impossible, though,&#8221; desperately.
&#8220;Nothing is impossible with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Roberts&#8217; great head shook a negative.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;This is. I can&#8217;t discuss it longer. Good-bye,
Elice.&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The girl&#8217;s brown eyes followed him as, decisively
now, he prepared to leave, and in hopeless,
abject misery. She spoke one word.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The listener halted, motionless as a figure in
clay.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley,&#8221; repeated the girl; and again that
was all.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Darley!&#8217;&#8221; It was the man&#8217;s voice this
time, but it sounded as though coming from a
distance. &#8220;&#8216;Darley!&#8217; At last!&mdash;and now!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley,&#8221; yet once again, &#8220;as I love you and
you love me don&#8217;t&mdash;desert me now!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
On the room fell a silence like death,&mdash;to
those two actors worse than death; for it held
thought infinite and complete realization at last
of what might have been and was not; of what
as well, unless a miracle intervened, could never
be. In it they stood, each where he was, two
figures in clay instead of one. Interrupting,
awakening, torturing, sounded the thing they
had so long expected; the impact of a step
upon the floor of the porch without; a moment
later another, uncertain, and another; a pause,
and then, startlingly loud, the trill of an electric
bell.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
For an instant neither stirred. It was the
expected; and still there is a limit to human
endurance. The girl was trembling, in a nervous
tension too great to bear longer. An effort
indeed she made at control; but it was a pitiful
effort and futile. In surrender absolute, abandon
absolute, she dropped back into her seat,
her arms crossed pathetically on the surface of
the library table, her face buried from sight
therein.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Answer it, please,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I can&#8217;t.
I&#8217;m ashamed, unutterably; but I can&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Again the alarm of the bell sounded; curtly
short this time and insistent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Without a word or even a pause Darley
Roberts obeyed. As he passed out he closed the
door carefully behind him.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Five minutes that seemed to the girl a lifetime
dragged by. Listening, she heard the
opening of the front door, the murmur of low,
speaking voices,&mdash;a murmur ceasing as abruptly
as it began; then, wonder of wonders, the door
closed again with a snap and a retreating step
sounded once, twice, as when it had come, on
the floor of the porch. Following, she marked
the even footfall of Roberts returning. The
electric switch that he had turned on snapped
back as he had found it, the intervening door
opened, and he entered. But, strange to say,
he did not pause or say a word. As one awakening
from a dream and not yet wholly conscious,
he returned silently to his former place.
On his face was a look she had never seen before,
which she could not fathom.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Darley.&#8221; Unbelieving the girl leaned toward
him appealingly. &#8220;Tell me. Wasn&#8217;t it&mdash;he?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
The man looked at her then, and there was
that in his gray eyes that tinged her face
crimson.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;No. It was Harry Randall,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right, Elice. The miracle came.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;The miracle!&#8221; The voice was uncertain
again, but from a far different cause this time.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep me waiting. Tell me. Is he&mdash;well?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
This time Roberts actually smiled,&mdash;smiled
as he had not done before in months.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; and writing like mad! That&#8217;s the
miracle. He&#8217;s been at it steady now for twenty
hours, and won&#8217;t even pause to eat. He sent
for Harry to deliver the message. It&#8217;s inspiration
he&#8217;s working under and he couldn&#8217;t stop
to come himself, wouldn&#8217;t. He said to tell you,
and me, that it was all right. He&#8217;d found himself
at last. Those were his words,&mdash;he&#8217;d
found himself at last.&#8221; As suddenly as it had
come the smile passed, and Roberts stood up,
his big hands locked behind his back.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;We&#8217;ve thought we understood him all these
years,&#8221; he said steadily, &#8220;but at last I realize
that we haven&#8217;t at all. It would be humorous
if it hadn&#8217;t been so near to tragedy, so very
near. Anyway, it&#8217;s clear now. Harry Randall
sees it too. That&#8217;s why he wouldn&#8217;t stay.
Steve Armstrong never cared for you really at
all, Elice. He thought he did&mdash;but he didn&#8217;t.
It was himself he cared for; and a fancy.
Neither you nor I nor any one can change him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
or help him more than temporarily. We&#8217;re
free. He&#8217;ll stand or go under as it was written
in the beginning.&#8221; The voice lowered until
it throbbed with the conviction that was in the
speaker&#8217;s soul. &#8220;No man alive who really cared
could find inspiration where he found it. The
world is before us and we&#8217;re free, Elice, free!&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
Unconsciously, in answer to an instinct she
obeyed without reason, the girl too arose, an
exaltation in her face no artist could reproduce
nor words describe.
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I see it all too at last.
We&#8217;ve all been blind.&#8221; She caught her breath
at the thought that would intrude, force it back
as she would. &#8220;And still we came so near, so
very, very near&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p style='font-size: 1.0em'>
&#8220;Yes; but it&#8217;s past.&#8221; The man opposite
was advancing. Not the impassive, cold Darley
Roberts the world knew, but the other Darley
Roberts revealed to one alone; the isolate
human alone and lonely. &#8220;But it&#8217;s past, past,
do you hear? And to-day is December the
sixth, our anniversary&mdash;ours.&#8221; He halted,
waiting. He smiled, with a tenderness infinite.
&#8220;Is it &#8216;Darley&#8217; still, Elice? Won&#8217;t you come
and say it again?&#8221;
</p>
<p style='text-align: center; font-size: 1.0em'>
THE END
